## 3. Domain Naming Requirements

- [x] Distinct from ASPPB domain names
- [x] Distinct from CSV source domain names (PHY, PPA, CLI, etc.)
- [x] Professional character (like "Psychopathology", "Biopsychology")
- [x] Can be "iterations" (e.g., "Physiological Psychology" → "Biopsychology")
- [x] Recognizable to PrepJet and ASPPB but NOT exactly the same

## 4. Thematic Lean/Character Requirements

Each domain has a distinctive thematic lean:
- [x] Domain 1: Statistical reasoning & validity
- [x] Domain 2: Stage theories & critical periods
- [x] Domain 3: Genetics & etiology
- [x] Domain 4: Mechanisms of change
- [x] Domain 5: Identity & group dynamics
- [x] Domain 6: Human performance & systems
- [x] Domain 7: Brain anatomy & neural circuits (BIG 4)

### Prerequisite Sequencing
- [x] Each domain builds on knowledge from previous domains
- [x] Logical flow for optimal learning
- [x] **CRITICAL: Biopsychology (Domain 7) MUST precede Pharmacology (Domain 9)**

## 6. Content Sequencing Rules

- [x] Neurotransmitters: Introduced in Domain 7 (Biopsychology)
- [x] Pharmacology: LAST (Domain 9 capstone)
- [x] Normal development before psychopathology
- [x] Research/measurement foundations early
- [x] Ethics integrated with pharmacology in capstone
- [x] **Biopsychology → Pharmacology prerequisite chain honored**

## 7. Content Mapping Rules

- [x] Anchor point content summaries remain the same
- [x] Only organization/grouping changes
- [x] Content can be re-sorted across original source domains
- [x] Priority: Present and sequence for optimal scaffolding and learning

## 8. Academic Integrity Requirements

- [x] Different organization from ASPPB
- [x] Complete reconceptualization
- [x] Transformative reorganization
- [x] Original domain names
- [x] Content fidelity maintained

## 9. Domain Size Constraints (NEW in v2.1)

- [x] **Minimum**: 130 anchor points per domain
- [x] **Maximum**: 200 anchor points per domain
- [x] All domains verified within range

### Domain Size Verification (v2.3 - Verified)
| Domain | Size | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| 1 (Psychometrics) | 193 | ✓ OK |
| 2 (Developmental) | 175 | ✓ OK |
| 3 (Psychopathology) | 185 | ✓ OK |
| 4 (Therapeutic) | 168 | ✓ OK |
| 5 (Social/Cultural) | 153 | ✓ OK |
| 6 (Organizational) | 173 | ✓ OK |
| 7 (Biopsychology) | 192 | ✓ OK |
| 8 (Assessment) | 152 | ✓ OK |
| 9 (Pharma/Ethics) | 179 | ✓ OK |

## 10. Additional Constraints

- [x] 9 domains total
- [x] All ~1,570 anchor points mapped
- [x] Question distribution reasonable across domains
- [x] Domains have "character" in a professional way

## 11. v2.0 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v1.0 | v2.0 |
|------------|------|------|
| 4th Big 4 Position | 8 | 7 (range expanded to 7-9) |
| 4th Big 4 Domain | Assessment | Biopsychology |
| Biopsychology Status | Non-Big 4 (25%) | Big 4 (45%) |
| Assessment Status | Big 4 (45%) | Non-Big 4 (30%) |
| Prerequisite Chain | Implicit | Explicit (Domain 7 → Domain 9) |

## 12. v2.1 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.0 | v2.1 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 8 Size | ~95-110 | ~135-145 |
| Domain 9 Size | ~225-240 | ~190-200 |
| Domain Size Constraint | None | 130-200 anchor points |
| ETH Distribution | 100% D9 | 22% D8, 78% D9 |
| ETH Standards 9 & 10 | Domain 9 | Domain 8 |
| ETH Professional Issues | All D9 | Split D8/D9 |

## 13. v2.2 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.1 | v2.2 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 1 Size | 205 (VIOLATION) | 193 |
| Domain 3 Size | 210 (VIOLATION) | 190 |
| Domain 7 Size | 172 | 192 |
| Domain 8 Size | 140 | 152 |
| TES: Test Score Interpretation | Domain 1 | Domain 8 |
| PPA: Neurocognitive Disorders | Domain 3 | Domain 7 |

**Rationale:**
- Test Score Interpretation moved to D8 (interpretation belongs with clinical assessment)
- Neurocognitive Disorders moved to D7 (brain-based disorders belong with biopsychology)

## 14. v2.3 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.2 | v2.3 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 3 Size | 190 | 185 |
| Domain 9 Size | 174 | 179 |
| Pharmacology in D3 | 4 items | 0 items |

**Moved anchor points (D3 → D9):**
- PPA: Neurodevelopmental Disorders [03] - Antipsychotics for tics
- PPA: Sexual Dysfunctions... [21] - Serotonin for premature ejaculation
- PPA: Bipolar and Depressive Disorders [27] - St. John's wort + SSRI interaction
- PPA: Bipolar and Depressive Disorders [157] - St. John's wort comparison to SSRIs

**Rationale:**
- Reduces prerequisite violation (pharmacology content appearing before biopsychology)
- Drug mechanism content belongs in Psychopharmacology domain
- D3 now focuses purely on disorder presentation/etiology

## 15. v2.4 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.3 | v2.4 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 9 Fundamental % | 20% | 30% |
| Domain 9 Mastery % | 80% | 70% |

**Rationale:**
- Drug classes, mechanisms, and side effects require memorization
- APA Ethics Code standards (1-10) require memorization
- 20% fundamental was too aggressive for capstone content
- D9 now matches other non-Big 4 domains at 30%/70%

## 16. v2.5 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.4 | v2.5 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 3 Personality | "The nosologist" | "The psychopathologist" |

**Rationale:**
- "Nosologist" (classifier) didn't match lean "Genetics & etiology" (causation)
- "Psychopathologist" matches domain name "Clinical Psychopathology"
- Encompasses both etiology (causes) and disease processes (presentation)

## 17. v2.6 - Cognitive-Affective Content (Design Note)

**Issue Raised:** EPPP tests "Cognitive-Affective Bases" at ~13%, but no domain has a "cognitive" lean.

**Resolution:** Closed - by design.

Cognitive-affective content is intentionally distributed across domains for thematic coherence:

| EPPP Content | Distribution |
|--------------|--------------|
| Learning/Conditioning | D1 (theory) + D4 (interventions) |
| Memory | D7 (Biopsychology) |
| Perception/Sensation | D7 (Biopsychology) |
| Emotion | D7 (Biopsychology) |
| Cognitive Development | D2 (Developmental) |
| Intelligence | D8 (Assessment) |

This is a deliberate design choice, not an omission.
