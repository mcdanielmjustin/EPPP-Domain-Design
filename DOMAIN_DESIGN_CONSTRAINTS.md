## 10. Additional Constraints

- [x] 9 domains total
- [x] All ~1,570 anchor points mapped
- [x] Question distribution reasonable across domains
- [x] Domains have "character" in a professional way

## 11. v2.0 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v1.0 | v2.0 |
|------------|------|------|
| 4th Big 4 Position | 8 | 7 (range expanded to 7-9) |
| 4th Big 4 Domain | Assessment | Biopsychology |
| Biopsychology Status | Non-Big 4 (25%) | Big 4 (45%) |
| Assessment Status | Big 4 (45%) | Non-Big 4 (30%) |
| Prerequisite Chain | Implicit | Explicit (Domain 7 → Domain 9) |

## 12. v2.1 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.0 | v2.1 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 8 Size | ~95-110 | ~135-145 |
| Domain 9 Size | ~225-240 | ~190-200 |
| Domain Size Constraint | None | 130-200 anchor points |
| ETH Distribution | 100% D9 | 22% D8, 78% D9 |
| ETH Standards 9 & 10 | Domain 9 | Domain 8 |
| ETH Professional Issues | All D9 | Split D8/D9 |

## 13. v2.2 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.1 | v2.2 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 1 Size | 205 (VIOLATION) | 193 |
| Domain 3 Size | 210 (VIOLATION) | 190 |
| Domain 7 Size | 172 | 192 |
| Domain 8 Size | 140 | 152 |
| TES: Test Score Interpretation | Domain 1 | Domain 8 |
| PPA: Neurocognitive Disorders | Domain 3 | Domain 7 |

**Rationale:**
- Test Score Interpretation moved to D8 (interpretation belongs with clinical assessment)
- Neurocognitive Disorders moved to D7 (brain-based disorders belong with biopsychology)

## 14. v2.3 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.2 | v2.3 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 3 Size | 190 | 185 |
| Domain 9 Size | 174 | 179 |
| Pharmacology in D3 | 4 items | 0 items |

**Moved anchor points (D3 → D9):**
- PPA: Neurodevelopmental Disorders [03] - Antipsychotics for tics
- PPA: Sexual Dysfunctions... [21] - Serotonin for premature ejaculation
- PPA: Bipolar and Depressive Disorders [27] - St. John's wort + SSRI interaction
- PPA: Bipolar and Depressive Disorders [157] - St. John's wort comparison to SSRIs

**Rationale:**
- Reduces prerequisite violation (pharmacology content appearing before biopsychology)
- Drug mechanism content belongs in Psychopharmacology domain
- D3 now focuses purely on disorder presentation/etiology

## 15. v2.4 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.3 | v2.4 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 9 Fundamental % | 20% | 30% |
| Domain 9 Mastery % | 80% | 70% |

**Rationale:**
- Drug classes, mechanisms, and side effects require memorization
- APA Ethics Code standards (1-10) require memorization
- 20% fundamental was too aggressive for capstone content
- D9 now matches other non-Big 4 domains at 30%/70%

## 16. v2.5 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v2.4 | v2.5 |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain 3 Personality | "The nosologist" | "The psychopathologist" |

**Rationale:**
- "Nosologist" (classifier) didn't match lean "Genetics & etiology" (causation)
- "Psychopathologist" matches domain name "Clinical Psychopathology"
- Encompasses both etiology (causes) and disease processes (presentation)

## 17. v2.6 - Cognitive-Affective Content (Design Note)

**Issue Raised:** EPPP tests "Cognitive-Affective Bases" at ~13%, but no domain has a "cognitive" lean.

**Resolution:** Closed - by design.

Cognitive-affective content is intentionally distributed across domains for thematic coherence:

| EPPP Content | Distribution |
|--------------|--------------|
| Learning/Conditioning | D1 (theory) + D4 (interventions) |
| Memory | D7 (Biopsychology) |
| Perception/Sensation | D7 (Biopsychology) |
| Emotion | D7 (Biopsychology) |
| Cognitive Development | D2 (Developmental) |
| Intelligence | D8 (Assessment) |

This is a deliberate design choice, not an omission.

## 18. v2.7 - Domain 9 Structure (Design Note)

**Issue Raised:** Pharmacology + Ethics have no genuine thematic connection ("forced marriage").

**Resolution:** Closed - by design.

Both components share a common prerequisite structure - they require **integration of prior domains**:

| Component | Prerequisites |
|-----------|---------------|
| Pharmacology | D7 (neurotransmitters) + D3 (disorders) + D4 (treatment) |
| Ethics | D1 (research) + D3 (diagnosis) + D4 (therapy) + D8 (assessment) |

**Thematic Connection:** Professional integration - applying all prior knowledge responsibly.

The personality "The integrator" captures this capstone nature.

## 19. v2.8 - Data Quality Fixes

**Issues Fixed:**

1. **"Error: Rewrite failed" anchor points (12 items)**
   - Added fallback to column 7 (full explanation) when column 9 has rewrite error
   - All 12 broken anchor points now display actual content

2. **Duplicate subdomain headers (14 pairs)**
   - Added `normalize_subdomain()` function to merge:
     - Trailing hyphens (e.g., `Disorders` vs `Disorders-`)
     - `&` vs `and` variations
     - Case differences (`disorders` vs `Disorders`)

3. **Duplicate anchor point IDs**
   - Added suffix for duplicate IDs within same subdomain
   - Example: `[01]`, `[01]`, `[01]` → `[01-1]`, `[01-2]`, `[01-3]`
   - Unique IDs remain unchanged

## 20. v2.9 - Content-Based Overrides and Deduplication

**Issues Fixed:**

1. **Gender Dysphoria misplacement**
   - Replaced ID-based override with content-based drug term matching
   - Removed: `('PPA', 'Sexual Dysfunctions...', '21'): 9` override
   - Added: `is_pharmacology_content()` function with drug term list
   - Result: Gender dysphoria anchor points stay in D3; only pharmacology content moves to D9

2. **Content duplication (3 items)**
   - Added deduplication by content key (first 100 chars, lowercased)
   - Removed 3 duplicate anchor points across D2, D3, D6
   - Total anchor points: 1570 → 1567

**Domain size updates (v2.9):**
| Domain | v2.8 Size | v2.9 Size | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 2 | 175 | 174 | -1 (dedup) |
| 3 | 185 | 179 | -6 (pharma move + dedup) |
| 6 | 173 | 172 | -1 (dedup) |
| 9 | 179 | 184 | +5 (pharma move) |

## 21. v2.10 - Header Normalization and Quality Review

**Issues Fixed:**

1. **Domain 5 duplicate subdomain headers**
   - "Errors, Bias, and Heuristics" vs "Errors, Biases, and Heuristics"
   - Added normalization: `s.replace('Errors, Bias, and Heuristics', 'Errors, Biases, and Heuristics')`
   - Consolidated: 1 + 14 = 15 items under single header

2. **Domain 9 split Ethics headers**
   - Variations like "Standards 1 & 2" vs "Standards 1 and 2" vs "Ethics Code Overview..."
   - Added pattern-based normalization for all 5 Ethics Standard pairs
   - All headers now use consistent format: "APA Ethics Code [Overview and] Standards X and Y"

**Issues Reviewed (No Change Needed):**

1. **Little Albert factual error claim** - VERIFIED CORRECT
   - Entry [008]: "white rat was the conditioned stimulus" is accurate
   - After conditioning, the rat (originally neutral) became the CS
   - No factual error present

2. **Tort law entry length** - SOURCE DATA ISSUE
   - Entry [022] in D9 is ~200 words (typical: 30-50 words)
   - Content is accurate but verbose
   - This is source CSV content, not an export issue
   - Documented as known data quality characteristic

3. **Skewed distributions entry length** - SOURCE DATA ISSUE (v2.12)
   - Entry [058] in D1 is ~150 words / 923 characters
   - Covers: definition, negative/positive skew, mean/median/mode ordering
   - Content is accurate and pedagogically complete
   - Could be split into 2-3 anchor points in future source data revision
   - Documented as known data quality characteristic

## 22. v2.13 - Domain Naming for Uniqueness

**Issue:** Domain names collided with PrepJet competitor names (Con #8 from comprehensive assessment).

**Collisions identified:**
- D6: "Organizational Psychology" = PrepJet's exact name
- D8: "Psychological Assessment" = PrepJet's exact name

**Resolution:** Renamed 6 domains to ensure uniqueness from both ASPPB and PrepJet:

| Domain | Old Name | New Name |
|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Psychometrics & Scientific Foundations | Psychometrics & Research Methods |
| 2 | Developmental Psychology | Lifespan & Developmental Stages |
| 4 | Therapeutic Psychology | Psychotherapy Models, Interventions, & Prevention |
| 6 | Organizational Psychology | Workforce Development & Leadership |
| 8 | Psychological Assessment | Clinical Assessment & Interpretation |
| 9 | Psychopharmacology & Professional Ethics | Psychopharmacology & Ethics |

**Naming criteria applied:**
- Recognition: Will EPPP students recognize the content area?
- Uniqueness: Different from ASPPB and PrepJet names?
- Content Fit: Does it match the actual anchor point allocation?
- Memorability: Easy to recall?

**Result:** All 9 domains now have unique names that:
- Use generic academic terminology (not copyrightable)
- Describe content accurately
- Are distinct from all competitor branding
