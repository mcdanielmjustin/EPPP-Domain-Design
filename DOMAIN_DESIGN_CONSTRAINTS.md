# Domain Design Constraints Checklist (v2.0)

## 1. Big 4 Model Rules

### Position Requirements
- [x] Big 4 Domain #1: Position 1 (Psychometrics)
- [x] Big 4 Domain #2: Position 2 (Developmental)
- [x] Big 4 Domain #3: Position 5 (range 4-6) (Social/Cultural)
- [x] Big 4 Domain #4: Position 7 (range 7-9) (Biopsychology)

### Fundamental Percentage Requirements (Big 4)
- [x] Position 1: 60% Fundamental, 40% Mastery
- [x] Position 2: 55% Fundamental, 45% Mastery
- [x] Position 5: 50% Fundamental, 50% Mastery
- [x] Position 7: 45% Fundamental, 55% Mastery

## 2. Non-Big 4 Rules (Positions 3, 4, 6, 8, 9)

- [x] Maximum 30% Fundamental (cap)
- [x] Minimum 70% Mastery
- [x] Range: 20-30% Fundamental

### Non-Big 4 Assignments
- [x] Position 3: Clinical Psychopathology (30%)
- [x] Position 4: Therapeutic Psychology (25%)
- [x] Position 6: Organizational Psychology (30%)
- [x] Position 8: Psychological Assessment (30%) - *moved from Big 4*
- [x] Position 9: Psychopharmacology & Ethics (20%) - Capstone

## 3. Domain Naming Requirements

- [x] Distinct from ASPPB domain names
- [x] Distinct from CSV source domain names (PHY, PPA, CLI, etc.)
- [x] Professional character (like "Psychopathology", "Biopsychology")
- [x] Can be "iterations" (e.g., "Physiological Psychology" → "Biopsychology")
- [x] Recognizable to PrepJet and ASPPB but NOT exactly the same

## 4. Thematic Lean/Character Requirements

Each domain has a distinctive thematic lean:
- [x] Domain 1: Statistical reasoning & validity
- [x] Domain 2: Stage theories & critical periods
- [x] Domain 3: Genetics & etiology
- [x] Domain 4: Mechanisms of change
- [x] Domain 5: Identity & group dynamics
- [x] Domain 6: Human performance & systems
- [x] Domain 7: Brain anatomy & neural circuits (BIG 4)
- [x] Domain 8: Clinical interpretation & profiles
- [x] Domain 9: Drug mechanisms & ethical decision-making

## 5. Scaffolding Requirements

### Bloom's Taxonomy Progression
- [x] Early domains: Remember, Understand
- [x] Middle domains: Apply, Analyze
- [x] Later domains: Evaluate, Create

### Webb's Depth of Knowledge
- [x] Level 1-2 (Recall, Skill/Concept) in foundational content
- [x] Level 3-4 (Strategic Thinking, Extended Thinking) in mastery content

### Prerequisite Sequencing
- [x] Each domain builds on knowledge from previous domains
- [x] Logical flow for optimal learning
- [x] **CRITICAL: Biopsychology (Domain 7) MUST precede Pharmacology (Domain 9)**

## 6. Content Sequencing Rules

- [x] Neurotransmitters: Introduced in Domain 7 (Biopsychology)
- [x] Pharmacology: LAST (Domain 9 capstone)
- [x] Normal development before psychopathology
- [x] Research/measurement foundations early
- [x] Ethics integrated with pharmacology in capstone
- [x] **Biopsychology → Pharmacology prerequisite chain honored**

## 7. Content Mapping Rules

- [x] Anchor point content summaries remain the same
- [x] Only organization/grouping changes
- [x] Content can be re-sorted across original source domains
- [x] Priority: Present and sequence for optimal scaffolding and learning

## 8. Academic Integrity Requirements

- [x] Different organization from ASPPB
- [x] Complete reconceptualization
- [x] Transformative reorganization
- [x] Original domain names
- [x] Content fidelity maintained

## 9. Additional Constraints

- [x] 9 domains total
- [x] All ~1,570 anchor points mapped
- [x] Question distribution reasonable across domains
- [x] Domains have "character" in a professional way

## 10. v2.0 Changes Summary

| Constraint | v1.0 | v2.0 |
|------------|------|------|
| 4th Big 4 Position | 8 | 7 (range expanded to 7-9) |
| 4th Big 4 Domain | Assessment | Biopsychology |
| Biopsychology Status | Non-Big 4 (25%) | Big 4 (45%) |
| Assessment Status | Big 4 (45%) | Non-Big 4 (30%) |
| Prerequisite Chain | Implicit | Explicit (Domain 7 → Domain 9) |
