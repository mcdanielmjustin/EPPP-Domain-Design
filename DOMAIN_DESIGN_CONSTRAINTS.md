# Domain Design Constraints Checklist

## 1. Big 4 Model Rules

### Position Requirements
- [ ] Big 4 Domain #1: Position 1
- [ ] Big 4 Domain #2: Position 2
- [ ] Big 4 Domain #3: Position 5 (range 4-6)
- [ ] Big 4 Domain #4: Position 8 (range 7-8)

### Fundamental Percentage Requirements (Big 4)
- [ ] Position 1: 60% Fundamental, 40% Mastery
- [ ] Position 2: 55% Fundamental, 45% Mastery
- [ ] Position 5: 50% Fundamental, 50% Mastery
- [ ] Position 8: 45% Fundamental, 55% Mastery

## 2. Non-Big 4 Rules (Positions 3, 4, 6, 7, 9)

- [ ] Maximum 30% Fundamental (cap)
- [ ] Minimum 70% Mastery
- [ ] Range: 20-30% Fundamental

## 3. Domain Naming Requirements

- [ ] Distinct from ASPPB domain names
- [ ] Distinct from CSV source domain names (PHY, PPA, CLI, etc.)
- [ ] Professional character (like "Psychopathology", "Physiological Psychology")
- [ ] Can be "iterations" (e.g., "Physiological Psychology" → "Anatomy and Physiology")
- [ ] Recognizable to PrepJet and ASPPB but NOT exactly the same

## 4. Thematic Lean/Character Requirements

Each domain must have a distinctive thematic lean:
- [ ] Domain 1: Statistical reasoning & validity
- [ ] Domain 2: Stage theories & critical periods
- [ ] Domain 3: Genetics & etiology
- [ ] Domain 4: Mechanisms of change
- [ ] Domain 5: Identity & group dynamics
- [ ] Domain 6: Human performance & systems
- [ ] Domain 7: Brain anatomy & neural circuits
- [ ] Domain 8: Clinical interpretation & profiles
- [ ] Domain 9: Drug mechanisms & ethical decision-making

Note: Psychopathology-type content leans into genetics

## 5. Scaffolding Requirements

### Bloom's Taxonomy Progression
- [ ] Early domains: Remember, Understand
- [ ] Middle domains: Apply, Analyze
- [ ] Later domains: Evaluate, Create

### Webb's Depth of Knowledge
- [ ] Level 1-2 (Recall, Skill/Concept) in foundational content
- [ ] Level 3-4 (Strategic Thinking, Extended Thinking) in mastery content

### Prerequisite Sequencing
- [ ] Each domain builds on knowledge from previous domains
- [ ] Logical flow for optimal learning

## 6. Content Sequencing Rules

- [ ] Neurotransmitters: DELAYED (not in early domains)
- [ ] Pharmacology: LAST (Domain 9 or capstone)
- [ ] Normal development before psychopathology
- [ ] Research/measurement foundations early
- [ ] Ethics integrated with pharmacology in capstone

## 7. Content Mapping Rules

- [ ] Anchor point content summaries remain the same
- [ ] Only organization/grouping changes
- [ ] Content can be re-sorted across original source domains
- [ ] Priority: Present and sequence for optimal scaffolding and learning

## 8. Academic Integrity Requirements

- [ ] Different organization from ASPPB
- [ ] Complete reconceptualization
- [ ] Transformative reorganization
- [ ] Original domain names
- [ ] Content fidelity maintained

## 9. Additional Constraints

- [ ] 9 domains total
- [ ] All ~1,570 anchor points must be mapped
- [ ] Question distribution should be reasonable across domains
- [ ] Domains should have "character" in a professional way
