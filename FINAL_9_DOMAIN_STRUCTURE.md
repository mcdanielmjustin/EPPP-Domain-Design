- **Mastery (55%):** Predicting lesion effects, interpreting neuroimaging, understanding circuit dysfunction in disorders, applying neurotransmitter knowledge to clinical presentations

### Prerequisite Role
**BIG 4 DOMAIN** - Provides critical foundation for:
- Domain 9 (pharmacology requires neurotransmitter knowledge)
- Understanding biological bases of psychopathology
- Neuropsychological assessment interpretation

**Note:** Neurotransmitters are introduced here (delayed as requested). This domain MUST precede Domain 9 (Pharmacology) because all drug mechanisms require understanding of neurotransmitter systems and receptor mechanisms.

### Estimated Questions: ~180-200

---

## Domain 8: Psychological Assessment

### Character
**Thematic Lean:** Clinical interpretation & profiles
**Personality:** "The diagnostician" - interpretation-focused, profile-oriented, integrative

### Why This Lean?

## Domain 9: Psychopharmacology & Professional Ethics

### Character
**Thematic Lean:** Drug mechanisms & ethical decision-making
**Personality:** "The integrator" - mechanism-focused, principle-driven, professionally-grounded

### Why This Lean?
Two complementary foci: (1) HOW drugs work at the neurochemical level, and (2) HOW to navigate ethical complexity. Both require sophisticated decision-making and integration of prior knowledge. Focuses on ethics related to research, competence, confidentiality, and advertising rather than assessment-specific ethics.

### Content Mapping

| Source | Subdomain | Lean Justification |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| PHY | Psychopharmacology - Antipsychotics/Antidepressants | Drug mechanisms, receptor effects (dopamine antagonism, serotonin reuptake) |

- **Mastery (80%):** Predicting drug effects/interactions, side effect profiles (NMS, tardive dyskinesia, serotonin syndrome), navigating ethical dilemmas, integrating biological and ethical considerations

### Prerequisite Role
**CAPSTONE DOMAIN** - Requires integration of:
- Domain 7 (neural circuits and neurotransmitters for drug mechanisms)
- All clinical domains (for ethical scenarios)
- Research foundations (for research ethics)

**Critical Prerequisite:** Domain 7 (Biopsychology) MUST come before this domain. Students cannot understand "SSRIs inhibit serotonin reuptake" without first learning what serotonin is and how reuptake works.

**Note:** Pharmacology positioned last as requested. Assessment/therapy ethics (Standards 9 & 10) and forensic professional issues moved to Domain 8.

### Estimated Questions: ~190-200

| Change | v2.0 | v2.1 | Rationale |
|--------|------|------|-----------|
| Domain 8 Size | ~95-110 | ~135-145 | Rebalanced to meet 130-200 constraint |
| Domain 9 Size | ~225-240 | ~190-200 | Rebalanced to meet 130-200 constraint |
| ETH Standards 9 & 10 | Domain 9 | Domain 8 | Assessment/therapy ethics fit Assessment domain thematically |
| ETH Professional Issues | All Domain 9 | Split D8/D9 | Forensic/assessment-related issues moved to Domain 8 |
| ETH Distribution | 100% D9 | 22% D8, 78% D9 | Better thematic alignment and size constraints |

**v2.1 Constraint:** All domains must have 130-200 anchor points

## Academic Integrity Statement

This domain structure represents original intellectual work that:

1. **Re-clusters content** based on thematic leans derived from comprehensive anchor point analysis
2. **Creates distinctive domain characters** that differentiate our approach
3. **Applies scaffolding theory** based on prerequisite relationship mapping
4. **Integrates across traditional boundaries** (e.g., conditioning split between Domains 1 and 4; memory split between Domains 4 and 7)
5. **Maintains content fidelity** while transforming organizational framework
6. **Follows the Big 4 model** with dispersed fundamental reinforcement
7. **Honors critical prerequisite chains** (Biopsychology → Pharmacology)

The structure is recognizable to psychology professionals while being distinctly organized for optimal learner outcomes.
