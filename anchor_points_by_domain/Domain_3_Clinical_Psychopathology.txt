[10] The DSM-5 diagnosis of agoraphobia requires the presence of marked anxiety related to at least two of five situations - using public transportation, being in open spaces, being in enclosed spaces, standing in line or being in a crowd, and being outside of the home alone, and learning that Sonia has anxiety attacks not only when she uses public transportation but also when she goes outside her house alone would help confirm this diagnosis.

[12] In vivo exposure is most effective when it's paired with applied tension rather than relaxation for specific phobia, blood-injection-injury type.

[028] Increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli is not included in the DSM-5 as a symptom of a panic attack, whereas depersonalization, fear of losing control or "going crazy," and paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations) are included.

[09] According to the DSM-5-TR, just under 7% of women experience a major depressive episode between birth of their offspring and 12 months postpartum.

[27] St. John's wort should not be taken with an SSRI because doing so can cause serotonin syndrome.

[08] No-suicide contracts don't reduce clients' risk for suicide or provide legal protection for therapists.

[190] Moffitt's (1993) "maturity gap" is most useful for understanding the etiology of adolescent-onset conduct disorder.

[210] The DSM-5 diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder cannot be assigned to individuals under the chronological age of six years or the equivalent developmental level.

[24] According to Moffitt (2003), the life-course persistent type of antisocial behavior is the result of a combination of inherited or acquired neurological deficits and environmental risks.

[23] Repeated acts of aggression are more characteristic of conduct disorder than oppositional defiant disorder and would suggest the possibility of comorbid conduct disorder.

[23] The four diagnostic categories for conduct disorder in the DSM-5 are aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violation of rules, but lack of remorse or guilt is a specifier for this disorder.

[22] The gap between biological and social maturity described by Moffitt (1993) is useful for explaining adolescent-onset conduct disorder.

[011] The DSM-5 diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder requires that the individual exhibit recurrent impulsive and aggressive outbursts that are manifested as either (a) verbal aggression or physical aggression for, on average, at least twice a week for at least three months, with physical aggression not causing damage or destruction of property or physical injury to other people or animals, or (b) three or more outbursts during a 12-month period that caused damage or destruction of property and/or physical injury to other people or animals.

[186] People with a non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorder, such as sleepwalking or sleep terror, experience incomplete awakening from sleep after an episode and have little or no memory for the event when awakened.

[20] Hypnagogic hallucinations occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, and people with narcolepsy often experience them, which may involve any sense but are most often visual.

[19] The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa does not require dieting or fasting to maintain low body weight.

[21] The nonpharmacological treatment-of-choice for insomnia disorder is a multi-component cognitive-behavioral intervention that incorporates stimulus control or sleep restriction with sleep-hygiene education, relaxation training, and/or cognitive therapy.

[16] Overvaluation of body weight and shape would be the least useful for confirming a DSM diagnosis of binge-eating disorder.

[20] Hypnopompic hallucinations occur during the transition from sleep to wakefulness.

[19] Hypnopompic hallucinations occur during the transition from sleep to wakefulness.

[17] Research has confirmed that the night alarm, also known as the moisture alarm, enuresis alarm, and bell-and-pad, has the best long-term effects for children who have received a DSM-5 diagnosis of enuresis, nocturnal only.

[023] As defined by Harvey, sleep-related safety behaviors are counterproductive coping strategies that are used to increase control over sleep but actually worsen insomnia by preventing disconfirmation of unhelpful beliefs, and these behaviors include clock watching to monitor the time it takes to fall asleep.

[025] The medication most useful for reducing daytime sleepiness, improving nighttime sleep, and reducing cataplexy in narcolepsy is sodium oxybate.

[061] Family-based treatment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa takes an agnostic view of the disorder and consists of three phases: parental control of the adolescent's eating, gradual return of control to the adolescent, and establishing age-appropriate independence in the adolescent.

[01] Lovaas (1987) used discrimination training and shaping to teach young nonspeaking children with autism spectrum disorder to communicate verbally.

[13] The primary difference between acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder is the duration of symptoms: The DSM-5 diagnosis of acute stress disorder requires a duration of three days to one month after exposure to a traumatic event, while the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder requires a duration of more than one month.

[024] Genuine memory loss is more likely when the beginning and end of the period of memory loss are gradual and blurred, and the defendant can recall fragments of some events that occurred during that period.

[005] The research on pre-trauma factors related to the risk for developing PTSD after exposure to a traumatic event has confirmed that female gender and low socioeconomic status are both associated with an increased risk.

[070] Face-to-face therapy is similarly effective as computer videoconferencing therapy for reducing PTSD symptoms and for maintaining treatment fidelity.

[032] Video electroencephalography (vEEG) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) as it involves simultaneously recording a person's brain electrical activity with an EEG and overt behaviors on video.

[14] The research is not entirely consistent with regard to the association between the use of stimulant drugs by children with ADHD and risk for developing an SUD later in life, with a meta-analysis finding that the use of stimulant medications to treat children with ADHD neither increased nor decreased the risk for later development of an SUD, but a more recent study finding that children with ADHD who began treatment with a stimulant drug at a young age and at a high dose were less likely to develop an SUD than were those who began treatment at an older age and at a lower dose.
