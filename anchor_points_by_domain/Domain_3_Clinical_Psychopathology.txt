[154] According to DSM-5, in contrast to people with nonpathological anxiety, those with generalized anxiety disorder are more likely to experience physical symptoms in conjunction with worrying and to experience worrying as uncontrollable.

[148] School refusal due to separation anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fear or anxiety about being separated from an attachment figure, accompanied by symptoms such as repeated nightmares related to separation and physical symptoms.

[134] Children with generalized anxiety disorder are most likely to worry about academic and athletic performance and about natural disasters.

[112] People with the blood-injection-injury type of specific phobia are more likely to experience vasovagal fainting instead of increased sympathetic nervous system arousal when confronted with the feared object or event.

[14] For a DSM-5 diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, the client must exhibit a fear of being embarrassed or humiliated in social situations.

[15] The median age of onset of specific phobia is between 7 and 11 years of age according to the DSM-5.

[11] Jessie's fear of being separated from her parents is characteristic of separation anxiety disorder which may be triggered by a life stress, such as the death of a pet.

[10] The DSM-5 diagnosis of agoraphobia requires the presence of marked anxiety related to at least two of five situations - using public transportation, being in open spaces, being in enclosed spaces, standing in line or being in a crowd, and being outside of the home alone, and learning that Sonia has anxiety attacks not only when she uses public transportation but also when she goes outside her house alone would help confirm this diagnosis.

[028] Increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli is not included in the DSM-5 as a symptom of a panic attack, whereas depersonalization, fear of losing control or "going crazy," and paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations) are included.

[077] Anna's symptoms are characteristic of emetophobia, a fear of vomiting, which is categorized in the DSM as a specific phobia, other type.

[110] The nature and duration of Maureen's symptoms, including increased energy and talkativeness, distractibility, increased goal activity, decreased need for sleep, and impaired functioning, are most suggestive of bipolar I disorder.

[121] Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by recurrent temper outbursts with a persistently irritable or angry mood between outbursts.

[068] If a client's episodes of depressive symptoms have never met all of the criteria for a major depressive episode, this would eliminate the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder.

[123] According to the DSM-5-TR, twin studies have produced heritability estimates of around 90% for bipolar disorder.

[079] A person must have experienced depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode and hypomanic symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode for at least 24 months for adults or 12 months for children and adolescents to receive a DSM-5 diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder.

[090] According to the hopelessness model of depression, the tendency to attribute negative life events to stable and global factors produces hopelessness, which then leads to a specific type of depression.

[11] The DSM-5 diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder requires the presence of symptoms for at least 24 months for adults and at least 12 months for children and adolescents.

[09-1] Major depressive disorder has been linked to decreased REM latency, reduced slow-wave (stages 3 and 4) sleep, prolonged sleep latency, and increased REM density, but not increased REM latency.

[10-1] There is growing consensus that no-suicide contracts are not an effective tool for preventing suicide and should not be used or should be used with caution.

[08-1] Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern, also known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), has been linked to a disruption in normal levels of melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland.

[12] In 2020, the suicide rate was highest for men 75 years of age and older.

[07] Alicia's diagnosis of major depressive disorder is confirmed by the presence of a loss of interest or pleasure in most activities, along with feelings of trouble concentrating, low energy, loss of appetite, and excessive sleeping.

[018] Lewinsohn's model of depression attributes it to a low rate of response-contingent reinforcement, based on the principles of operant conditioning.

[022] Chinese patients were more likely than Euro-Canadian patients to express somatic symptoms and less likely to express psychological symptoms of depression.

[003] The rates of major depressive disorder are about the same for boys and girls until puberty when there's a substantial increase in the rates for girls and the difference begins to approach the 2:1 female-to-male ratio that is found among adults.

[150] For a DSM diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, a person must have had at least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[190] Moffitt's (1993) "maturity gap" is most useful for understanding the etiology of adolescent-onset conduct disorder.

[210] The DSM-5 diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder cannot be assigned to individuals under the chronological age of six years or the equivalent developmental level.

[24] According to Moffitt (2003), the life-course persistent type of antisocial behavior is the result of a combination of inherited or acquired neurological deficits and environmental risks.

[23-1] Repeated acts of aggression are more characteristic of conduct disorder than oppositional defiant disorder and would suggest the possibility of comorbid conduct disorder.

[23-2] The four diagnostic categories for conduct disorder in the DSM-5 are aggression to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violation of rules, but lack of remorse or guilt is a specifier for this disorder.

[22] The gap between biological and social maturity described by Moffitt (1993) is useful for explaining adolescent-onset conduct disorder.

[011] The DSM-5 diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder requires that the individual exhibit recurrent impulsive and aggressive outbursts that are manifested as either (a) verbal aggression or physical aggression for, on average, at least twice a week for at least three months, with physical aggression not causing damage or destruction of property or physical injury to other people or animals, or (b) three or more outbursts during a 12-month period that caused damage or destruction of property and/or physical injury to other people or animals.

[019] Scared Straight programs, which aim to reduce the likelihood that juvenile offenders and youth at risk for becoming juvenile offenders will engage in future criminal behaviors by having them visit prisons and interact with adult inmates, have been found to increase the likelihood that participants will engage in future criminal behaviors.

[018] Male adolescents with conduct disorder showed hyporeactive (reduced) cortisol and cardiovascular responses to a stressful procedure when compared to adolescents without a psychiatric disorder, even though all three groups reported experiencing similar levels of negative feelings.

[20-1] Hypnagogic hallucinations occur during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, and people with narcolepsy often experience them, which may involve any sense but are most often visual.

[19] The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa does not require dieting or fasting to maintain low body weight.

[16] Overvaluation of body weight and shape would be the least useful for confirming a DSM diagnosis of binge-eating disorder.

[20-2] Hypnopompic hallucinations occur during the transition from sleep to wakefulness.

[023-1] As defined by Harvey, sleep-related safety behaviors are counterproductive coping strategies that are used to increase control over sleep but actually worsen insomnia by preventing disconfirmation of unhelpful beliefs, and these behaviors include clock watching to monitor the time it takes to fall asleep.

[002] Tourette's disorder is most frequently comorbid with ADHD.

[013] For the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, the DSM-5 requires symptoms to be present during the early developmental period, with symptoms usually recognized by the time the child is between 12 and 24 months of age but may occur earlier or later, depending on the severity of the symptoms.

[02-1] The DSM-5 diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) requires the onset of some symptoms before 12 years of age.

[04] The correct DSM-5 diagnosis for a 12-year-old boy who has two motor tics that began nine months ago is provisional tic disorder.

[11] Deficits in face recognition underlie many of the impairments in social functioning that are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder.

[09] ADHD is the most common comorbid psychiatric disorder for individuals with specific learning disorder.

[14] Hypersexuality is useful for distinguishing between juvenile bipolar disorder and ADHD because it is more common for youth with bipolar disorder than for those with ADHD.

[01] A better prognosis for individuals with autism spectrum disorder has been linked to the development of functional language skills by age 5.

[02-2] The DSM-5 diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) requires an onset of symptoms before 12 years of age and a duration of symptoms for at least 6 months.

[168] The presence of Carla being hypersensitive to criticism and rejection by others would be least useful for confirming a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD).

[30-1] People with schizotypal personality disorder may express unhappiness about their lack of relationships, but their behavior suggests a decreased desire for intimate contacts due to anxiety related to suspiciousness about the motivations of other people.

[29-1] Histrionic personality disorder, in contrast to antisocial personality disorder, is characterized by exaggerated expression of emotions.

[29-2] Adele's odd beliefs and magical thinking, suspiciousness, lack of close friends, social anxiety, and constricted affect are characteristic of schizotypal personality disorder.

[30-2] The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III) found that any substance use disorder was the most common comorbidity among adults with antisocial personality disorder.

[057] In his frequently cited review of the research, I. Gottesman reported a concordance rate for schizophrenia of 9% for non-twin siblings.

[035] Assuming that a woman's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of delusional disorder, the appropriate type of delusion is erotomanic if she's convinced that a local celebrity she met at a fundraiser six months ago is in love with her.

[046] Assuming that Gaylen's symptoms are not due to another mental disorder, a medical condition, or drug use, the most likely diagnosis is schizophreniform disorder, as she has had auditory hallucinations and disorganized speech for two months.

[05-1] The DSM-5 diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires the presence of delusions or hallucinations for at least two weeks without symptoms of a major depressive or manic episode.

[06-1] Expressed emotion has been linked to an increased risk for relapse for individuals with schizophrenia, depression, and several other mental disorders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[196] Autonomic hyperactivity, hand tremor, insomnia, transient hallucinations, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures are most suggestive of alcohol withdrawal, as described in the DSM-5.

[215] Many of the symptoms of opioid withdrawal are also associated with influenza, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, and fever.

[204] Text messaging is effective as a stand-alone treatment for smoking cessation, and text messaging plus other smoking interventions is more effective than other smoking interventions alone.

[218] Korsakoff syndrome is caused by a thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency and produces severe memory impairment and confabulation, and when it's the result of chronic alcohol abuse, it's categorized in the DSM-5 as alcohol-induced major neurocognitive disorder.

[178] Gale's symptoms meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder, which requires the presence of one or more somatic symptoms that cause distress or substantial disruption of daily activities accompanied by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the symptoms.

[172] When determining a client's diagnosis, knowing that the client's symptoms have lasted for less than one month would be most useful for distinguishing between posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder, as the primary difference is the duration of symptoms, with acute stress disorder requiring a duration of three days to one month and posttraumatic stress disorder requiring a duration of more than one month.

[150] The DSM-5 diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder requires preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in physical appearance that appear to be minor or are not apparent to others, accompanied by repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking) and significant distress or impaired functioning.

[16-2] The presence of persistent thoughts about the seriousness of symptoms can help confirm a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder.

[13] The primary difference between acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder is the duration of symptoms: The DSM-5 diagnosis of acute stress disorder requires a duration of three days to one month after exposure to a traumatic event, while the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder requires a duration of more than one month.

[014] A person whose primary symptom is psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is most likely to receive a diagnosis of functional neurological symptom disorder.
