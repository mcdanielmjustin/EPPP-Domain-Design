[089] During the contemplation stage of Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model of behavior change, people are aware of their problem behavior, are weighing the pros and cons of changing, and feel they'll be ready to take the steps necessary to change the behavior within the next six months.

[072] The solution-focused therapist's use of exception questions, such as asking what kind of things Brett does when he's not causing problems at home, is intended to help clients see that the presenting problem doesn't always occur and to identify potential solutions.

[028] In motivational interviewing, a client's sustain talk reflects the client's desire to maintain the status quo for the target behavior.

[086] Motivational interviewing combines elements of Bandura's self-efficacy theory, Rogers's person-centered therapy, and the transtheoretical model.

[075] Dr. Walter, a practitioner of solution-focused therapy, asks the "miracle question" to help his client identify solutions to their problems and goals for therapy.

[064] The transtheoretical model (also referred to as the stages of change model) proposes that interventions are most effective when they match the client's stage of change.

[053] Practitioners of interpersonal therapy view depression as being the result of unresolved grief, interpersonal deficits, role disputes, or role transitions.

[06-1] Practitioners of interpersonal therapy (IPT) focus on role transitions, role disputes, unresolved grief, and/or interpersonal deficits when working with clients who have a major depressive disorder.

[07-1] The transtheoretical model identifies decisional balance, self-efficacy, and temptation as factors that affect a person's motivation to change.

[09] Solution-focused therapists use scaling questions to help clients recognize the progress they've made toward achieving their goals.

[07-2] Interpersonal therapy views depression as a medically based condition.

[08-1] Practitioners of motivational interviewing use evocative questions to elicit change talk from clients.

[08-2] Miller and Rollnick's (2002) motivational interviewing incorporates principles of person-centered therapy.

[06-2] Solution-focused therapists use exception questions to help clients identify times when their problems did not exist or were less intense.

[05] For clients in the contemplation stage, self-liberation is likely to be the least useful intervention according to the transtheoretical model.

[024] At the end of the initial therapy session with a married couple who say they constantly argue, a practitioner of solution-focused therapy will assign them a task to complete before the next session that requires them to identify things in their relationship that they want to continue.

[002] Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is based on the medical model and views depression as an illness, and practitioners of IPT believe that assigning the "sick role" to patients is beneficial because it allows patients to be ill without blaming themselves for their symptoms and to view their illnesses as treatable.

[006] Practitioners of motivational interviewing who are familiar with Miller and Rollnick's (2013) current view of decisional balance (DB) are most likely to say that DB is most useful for assessing a client's readiness to change.

[194] Brief psychodynamic therapies (BPT) do not share the characteristic that BPT is based on the assumption that transference is an impediment to therapy.

[039] In motivational interviewing, the technique of "developing discrepancy" involves helping clients recognize the difference between their values and goals and their current behaviors.

[100] Beck's cognitive model of depression describes it as involving a negative cognitive triad that consists of negative views of oneself, the world, and the future.

[111] Stress inoculation training consists of three overlapping stages: conceptualization, skill acquisition and rehearsal, and application and follow-through.

[017] For practitioners of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), depression is due to psychological inflexibility, which is a core concept in ACT and a risk factor for depression and other psychological problems.

[153] In Beck's cognitive behavior therapy, the therapeutic relationship is described as collaborative empiricism, in which the therapist and client work together to identify treatment goals, reality test the client's beliefs, and derive a plan to resolve the client's problems.

[159] The first step in Meichenbaum's (1977) self-instructional training is cognitive modeling.

[165] Practitioners of acceptance and commitment therapy teach clients mindfulness techniques that help them perceive symptoms as uncomfortable or harmless transient psychological events.

[17-1] In Ellis's A-B-C model, A is the antecedent event, B is the person's beliefs about that event, and C is the person's emotional or behavioral response to those beliefs.

[02] The results of the frequently cited systematic review and meta-analysis of the research conducted by Gu et al. (2015) found decreases in cognitive and emotional reactivity to have the strongest and most consistent evidence as the change mechanism for mindfulness-based interventions.

[16-1] Anna's conclusion that students in her classes already think she's stupid is an example of arbitrary inference, a cognitive distortion identified by Beck.

[18-1] Practitioners of acceptance and commitment therapy distinguish between clean and dirty discomfort, with a goal of therapy being to replace dirty discomfort with clean discomfort.

[15-1] Automatic thoughts are spontaneous thoughts that "intercede between an event or stimulus and the individual's emotional and behavioral reactions".

[19] Mindfulness-based therapy is more effective for treating psychological disorders than physical/medical conditions.

[17-2] Practitioners of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) agree that the presence of psychological pain is universal and normal.

[18-2] People with a history of depression can avoid having another depressive episode by adopting a decentered position at the first sign of depression, according to the assumptions of mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT).

[15-2] A practitioner of Beck's cognitive behavior therapy uses the Socratic method to help clients identify and modify automatic thoughts.

[16-2] A new psychology instructor's conclusion that she must be "an incredibly boring and incompetent teacher" because two of the 65 students in the class walked out of the lecture hall before the period was over illustrates the cognitive distortion of arbitrary inference, as described by Aaron Beck.

[14] From the perspective of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), experiential avoidance, which occurs when a person is unwilling to stay in contact with unwanted thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and/or other internal experiences and engages in counterproductive behaviors to avoid or control them, is a primary cause of "dirty discomfort" or emotional distress and discomfort that results from unsuccessful attempts to control unwanted psychological experiences.

[17-3] Practitioners of Beck's cognitive behavior therapy would most likely use Socratic questions when working with clients to help them identify their distorted patterns of thinking and the effects of that thinking on their emotions and behaviors.

[22] The Stanley/Brown safety plan for people at-risk for suicide consists of six steps: (1) recognizing the warning signs, (2) using internal coping strategies, (3) utilizing social contacts, (4) contacting family or friends, (5) contacting mental health professionals, and (6) reducing access to lethal means, except for signing a no-suicide contract.

[013] When using the Dysfunctional Thought Record, clients initially record each situation that preceded an unpleasant emotion, the negative automatic thought that occurred in response to the situation, and the nature of the emotion and its intensity, and as therapy progresses, they also record a rational response to each negative automatic thought and the outcomes of the rational response.

[007] For practitioners of acceptance and commitment therapy, "dirty discomfort" is the result of unwillingness.

[003] The employee's conclusion that he is worthless and will never get promoted out of his entry-level job based on a single minor criticism in an otherwise positive performance review is an example of selective abstraction.

[224] Research suggests that using cognitive behavioral therapy as an adjunct treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis reduces pain intensity and fatigue, especially when it is provided early in the course of the disease.

[085] Practitioners of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) use cognitive defusion and mindfulness techniques to foster psychological flexibility.

[066] The primary goal of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is to help clients disengage from distressing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

[135] Imagery rescripting is used in cognitive behavior therapy to replace involuntary distressing and intrusive images related to a client's presenting problem with more adaptive images.

[050] Cognitive therapy for suicide prevention (CT-SP) has three stages, with the primary targets being emotion regulation, cognitive flexibility, and relapse prevention, in order.

[149] Using the paradoxical technique of positioning, the therapist accepts and exaggerates the client's concern in order to help the client recognize its absurdity or irrationality.

[122] John's parents' response to his demands for more independence and privileges by continuing to treat him like a child and becoming more punitive illustrates negative feedback, which serves to maintain the status quo rather than promote change.

[133] Murray Bowen viewed schizophrenia and other severe mental disorders as the result of a multigenerational transmission process.

[141] The family pattern of overprotective and emotionally overinvolved parents who discourage the child's independence, as found by Minuchin, Rosman, and Baker (1978) in families with children with anorexia, is referred to as enmeshed.

[108] The primary goal of Bowen's extended family systems therapy is to increase the differentiation of family members, which refers to a family member's ability to separate their own emotional and intellectual functioning from the functioning of other family members.

[097] In a complementary interaction, one partner adopts a dominant "one-up" position while the other partner adopts a submissive "one-down" position.

[130] A stable coalition occurs when two family members (often a parent and child) consistently "gang up" against a third family member (the other parent).

[139] Milan systemic family therapists use circular questioning to help family members recognize similarities and differences in their perceptions of a family event.

[119] The ordeal technique used by strategic family therapists involves instructing the client to do an unpleasant task whenever he or she engages in an undesirable behavior, with the goal of reducing or eliminating that behavior.

[11-1] A Bowenian extended family systems therapy practitioner uses a genogram to obtain information about the relationships among family members over multiple generations.

[12-1] Structural family therapists use joining, which involves entering the family system by adopting its behaviors and its communication style and content, to identify and alter the family's dysfunctional family structure and reassure family members that they're supported and understood.

[13-1] Practitioners of Milan systemic family therapy would be least likely to use fixed-role therapy, which is associated with Kelly's personal construct therapy and involves having clients adopt roles to "try out" different personal constructs.

[14] A practitioner of narrative family therapy will focus on how the presenting problem has affected the family.

[10-1] Positive feedback amplifies deviation from the status quo and promotes change, while negative feedback counteracts (attenuates) deviation and maintains the status quo.

[120] Multisystemic therapy is an evidence-based, home- and community-centered intervention based on Bronfenbrenner's ecological model for adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have serious antisocial behavioral problems and are at risk for out-of-home placement.

[13-2] In narrative family therapy, a unique outcome is a time when a problem was expected to occur but did not occur.

[11-2] Structural family therapists distinguish between three rigid triangles: detouring, stable coalition, and triangulation. Detouring occurs when two family members avoid their conflicts by focusing on a third family member. Often, it's the parents who avoid conflict by focusing on a child by supporting or scapegoating the child.

[09] Negative feedback corrects deviations in family functioning so the family can return to its previous state of stability (homeostasis). In contrast, positive feedback promotes deviation.

[12-2] Bowen's concept of differentiation refers to a family member's ability to experience connectedness and intimacy with other family members while maintaining independence from them.

[13-3] Circular questions are an essential technique of Milan systemic therapy and are used to assess and make overt the overall dynamics and interactive patterns in the system, thereby reframing the problem for all participants without the therapist having to verbally provide a reframe.

[10-2] A narrative family therapist is most likely to respond to the wife's statement by asking how long the depression has been controlling her life.

[026] The primary goal of structural family therapy is to resolve the family's presenting problem by altering the family's structure, including strategies that create clear boundaries between family members and subsystems by increasing the strength of diffuse boundaries or the flexibility of rigid boundaries.

[025] The initial session of strategic family therapy consists of four stages, where the first stage involves welcoming family members and helping them feel comfortable.

[027] Attachment theory is one of the influences on emotionally focused therapy for couples and process research confirms that its positive effects on relationship distress arise from expressing and responding to attachment needs in an emotionally meaningful way during therapy.

[094] Functional family therapy (FFT) is an evidence-based intervention for adolescents with conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder and their families.

[11-3] A primary goal of Milan systemic family therapy is to disrupt destructive family games ("dirty games") that involve deceit and power struggles and lead to and maintain symptoms.

[144] A practitioner of Minuchin's structural family therapy is most likely to say that detouring is occurring when parents avoid their own conflicts by scapegoating or overprotecting a child, as structural family therapists describe detouring as a type of rigid family triad, with detouring-attack coalition occurring when parents avoid the conflict between them by blaming (scapegoating) a child for their problems, and detouring-support coalition occurring when parents avoid their own conflict by overprotecting a child.

[061] Emotionally focused therapy (EFT) is a brief evidence-based treatment that integrates principles of experiential, humanistic, systemic, and attachment theories and views relationship distress as the result of negative interaction cycles that cause each partner's needs to be unmet and lead to feelings of insecurity and rejection, with the primary goals of helping couples strengthen their emotional bonds and develop new interaction cycles.

[020] Milan systemic family therapists use circular questions to help family members recognize differences in their perceptions about events and relationships and to uncover family communication patterns that are maintaining problematic behaviors.

[03] Minuchin's structural family therapy refers to the parents' conflict with each other and their recruitment of the child to side with them as an unstable coalition, also known as triangulation.

[109] The effectiveness of multisystemic therapy depends on a high level of treatment fidelity.

[09] Building a positive therapeutic alliance, reducing feelings of hopelessness, increasing motivation for change, and developing a family-focused understanding of the family's problems are most characteristic of the initial stage of functional family therapy.

[179-1] The diagnostic overshadowing bias is the tendency to attribute all of a person's symptoms to one diagnosis, such as a learning disability, and overlook the possibility of comorbid conditions.

[185] Research on medical cost offset has consistently found that providing psychotherapy to patients reduces expenditures on their medical care.

[161-1] Secondary preventions are aimed at lowering the prevalence of a disorder by identifying individuals with early signs or symptoms and providing them with an intervention to limit its intensity or duration.

[167] According to Howard et al.'s phase model, a client's improvement in the first few therapy sessions is most likely due to an increased sense of hope.

[083] The assessment of treatment fidelity focuses on the differentiation, adherence, and competency of the therapist in delivering the target treatment.

[155] Research comparing the outcomes of cognitive and behavioral interventions for depression delivered face-to-face or via telehealth generally found that telehealth is as effective as in-person therapy in terms of both symptom severity and patient satisfaction.

[177] A psychologist is engaged in consultee-centered case consultation when he helps a recently licensed psychotherapist acquire the knowledge and skills she needs to work with clients from a cultural group she has not worked with before.

[183] Smith, Glass, and Miller's (1980) meta-analysis of 475 psychotherapy outcome studies found an effect size of .85, meaning that the average individual who received therapy was better off than about 80% of individuals who needed therapy but did not receive it.

[171] Providing patients who have just completed substance abuse treatment with training in coping and relapse prevention skills is an example of tertiary prevention.

[21-1] Efficacy research has better internal validity but worse external validity compared to effectiveness research on psychotherapy outcomes.

[19-1] Theme interference, as described by Gerald Caplan (1970), is a loss of objectivity that occurs when a therapist's reactions to a particular type of client are affected by his/her previous experiences with that type of client.

[10-1] A program that targets the academic and behavioral functioning of children in elementary school whose parents have a substance use disorder is an example of selected prevention.

[20-1] According to Howard et al.'s (1986) dose-effect model, about 75% of therapy clients experience an improvement in symptoms by the 26th therapy session.

[22-1] Eysenck's review of the psychotherapy outcome research indicated that people who participate in psychotherapy often show less improvement than do people with similar symptoms who do not participate in therapy.

[11] The 2020 National Health Interview survey found that more adult female than male respondents had taken medication and/or received therapy or counseling for mental health conditions in the previous 12 months.

[21-2] A small software company manager hires an organizational psychologist to help motivate unproductive programmers with the necessary skills, which is an example of consultee-centered case consultation.

[22-2] Improvement in therapy during the first few sessions is usually due to increased feelings of hopefulness, according to the phase model developed by Howard and colleagues (1986).

[20-2] The psychologist's program for first-time parents that addresses methods of dealing with parenting stress and lifestyle changes and is open to all expectant parents in the community is an example of primary prevention.

[02] The transdiagnostic adaptation of emotion-focused therapy (EFT-T) targets chronic painful emotions of loneliness/sadness, shame, and fear/terror, which are due primarily to chronic emotional vulnerability, as a treatment for depression, anxiety, and related disorders.

[19-2] About 50% of psychotherapy clients show improvement by the sixth to eighth therapy session, 75% by the 26th session, and 85% after a little over a year.

[20-3] Smith, Glass, and Miller's (1980) meta-analysis of 475 psychotherapy outcome studies produced a mean effect size of .85, which means that the average patient who received psychotherapy was "better off" than 80% of patients who did not receive psychotherapy.

[21-3] Primary preventions target groups of people (e.g., older members of a community) who have not yet developed an undesirable behavior or condition (isolation) by intervening before the behavior or condition occurs.

[18] The primary methods for assessing the fidelity of community-based interventions are self-reports from practitioners and participants and observations of intervention sessions.

[27] Heinrich and colleagues (2010) used the acronym WEIRD to describe the lack of diversity in the characteristics of research participants.

[023] The best conclusion that can be drawn from research on the impact of age and gender on psychotherapy outcomes is that age and gender have little or no consistent impact on psychotherapy outcomes.

[016] The three primary functions of interprofessional collaboration in primary care settings, referred to as the "triple aim," are to improve the experience of care, improve the health of populations, and reduce the per capita cost of health care, but do not include reducing disparities in services.

[028] The research on the effects of routine outcome monitoring (ROM) has found that it improves symptom reduction and decreases premature termination and deterioration during therapy, especially for "not-on-track" clients.

[020] Efficacy studies that maximize internal validity are usually conducted first and effectiveness studies that maximize external validity are conducted next when evaluating the outcomes of a new treatment for a mental disorder.

[010] Based on the results of their research, Howard and his colleagues concluded that about 75% of psychotherapy clients show measurable improvements in symptoms by the 26th therapy session with an additional 10% showing measurable improvements by the 52nd session.

[004] Based on his review of psychotherapy outcome studies, Eysenck concluded that 72% of patients with neuroses can be expected to experience spontaneous recovery without treatment.

[019] A prenatal care program available to all pregnant women in a community is an example of universal prevention.

[015] A barrier to using cost benefit analysis is that it's often difficult to express the outcomes of mental health programs in monetary terms.

[059] A researcher would use cost-utility analysis to compare the effects of two interventions on quality-adjusted life-years (QALY).

[204] Hans Eysenck is known for his controversial conclusions about the heritability of intelligence.

[179-2] In a stepped care approach to treating individuals with low levels of depressive symptoms, the second step includes psychoeducation, bibliotherapy, and/or computer-aided CBT when symptoms do not remit.

[121] The two most frequently cited models of disability are the medical and social models.

[161-2] The acronym WEIRD refers to individuals from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic cultures, and Henrich and colleagues note that much of the published psychological research has relied on WEIRD samples.

[007] Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development, derived from research with male subjects, found that the typical male tends to function at stage 4, but when assessed with females, the typical female tends to function at stage 3, leading some to conclude that females are less morally developed than males, which best illustrates the concept of androcentrism.

[10-2] Adding human support improves the effectiveness of DMHIs whether it is provided by a mental health professional or nonprofessional.

[101] Telepsychology for bulimia nervosa has positive effects but may be less effective than in-person therapy in terms of some treatment outcomes.

[050] An assumption underlying Gestalt therapy is that contact boundary disturbances underlie neurosis, and it distinguishes between four main types of boundary disturbance: introjection, retroflection, projection, and confluence.

[039] Incongruence between self and experience produces anxiety, which a person may respond to defensively by denying or distorting the experience.

[006] Gerald, age 39, converted his undesirable impulses of jealousy and resentment towards his younger sister's recent business success into the opposite behavior of praising her accomplishments and encouraging her continued success, illustrating the defense mechanism of reaction formation.

[042] According to Glasser's reality therapy, irresponsible behavior leads to the development of a failure identity.

[009] A college undergraduate who usually gets A's and B's on exams received a C on a recent midterm exam, and he immediately assumed that the low grade was a mistake, which is best explained by the defense mechanism of denial.

[031] Gestalt therapy is most likely to agree that helping a client achieve awareness of his/her thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in the here-and-now is a primary goal of therapy.

[04-1] According to Carl Rogers, people often react defensively to incongruence by distorting or denying their experiences, which leads to psychological maladjustment.

[01] Greenson describes the process of analysis in psychoanalysis as involving confrontation, clarification, interpretation, and working through.

[05] According to reality therapists, when a person chooses to fulfill his/her needs in irresponsible ways, the person has adopted a failure identity which, in turn, causes depression and other problems.

[04-2] Conditions of worth contribute to incongruence according to Carl Rogers's personality theory.

[06] Practitioners of reality therapy would most likely agree that psychological pain is the result of ineffective attempts to satisfy one's needs.

[04-3] Reality therapy, based on choice theory, proposes that people have five genetically encoded needs, including love and belonging, power, fun, freedom, and survival, but not intimacy.

[07] Glasser's (1965) reality therapy is based on the assumption that people have five basic innate needs, excluding esteem.

[03] The primary goal of Jung's analytical psychotherapy is to bring unconscious material into consciousness to facilitate the process of individuation, which involves achieving individual "wholeness" (being a unique unified person) by becoming conscious of and harmonizing the various parts of the psyche.

[02] According to Carl Rogers, people often respond to incongruence with denial or distortion.

[001] The primary source of human motivation in Glasser's (1998) reality therapy is basic innate needs, such as survival, freedom, love and belonging, power, and fun.

[012] Csikszentmihaly coined the term flow to describe a state of engagement, focused attention, and complete absorption that a person can experience when working on a task that's challenging and intrinsically rewarding and that's accompanied by a sense of fulfillment and loss of the feeling of self-consciousness.

[075] For practitioners of positive psychology, the likely outcome when there is a balance between the level of challenge posed by a task and the skill level of the person performing the task is flow, a state of being totally immersed in an activity accompanied by joy and a sense of fulfillment.

[081] According to choice theory, all people are motivated to satisfy five genetically encoded needs: love/belonging, power, fun, freedom, and survival.

LEA: Interventions Based on Classical Conditioning (12 items)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[031] The effects of systematic desensitization for eliminating an anxiety response to a particular stimulus are actually due to extinction, as studies using the dismantling strategy found that it was repeated exposure to the feared (conditioned) stimulus that eliminated the anxiety response, and that pairing the feared stimulus with a stimulus that produced relaxation (counterconditioning) was unnecessary.

[06] Implosive therapy uses classical extinction to eliminate a fear response to an object or situation.

[04-1] Wolpe attributed the effects of systematic desensitization to reciprocal inhibition, which involves pairing presentation of a stimulus that produces anxiety with presentation of a stimulus that produces relaxation or other response that's incompatible with anxiety.

[05] The use of in vivo exposure to treat a specific phobia is based on the assumption that the feared object or situation is a conditioned stimulus.

[04-2] Cue exposure treatment for alcohol use disorder often combines exposure to cues associated with alcohol with coping skills training, which has been shown to increase its effectiveness.

[03-1] Implosive therapy combines exposure in imagination and psychodynamic techniques, where the client imagines the feared object or situation and the therapist embellishes the imagined scene with psychodynamic themes such as aggression, guilt, or sexuality.

[04-3] Covert sensitization uses aversive counterconditioning to eliminate an undesirable behavior.

[03-2] Davidson and Parker (2001) concluded that the beneficial effects of EMDR are due to exposure in imagination, not rapid eye movements.

[012] In terms of classical conditioning, a trusted friend is a conditioned inhibitor for a woman with panic disorder who believes she can avoid having a panic attack by having the friend with her in situations that have elicited an attack in the past.

[003] When using aversive counterconditioning to treat a client's fetishistic disorder, the fetish object is the conditioned stimulus.

[189] As conceptualized by Shapiro and her colleagues, the rapid eye movement component of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing exerts its beneficial effects on the symptoms of PTSD by accelerating information processing and adaptive resolution of traumatic memories.

[092] Systematic desensitization is counterconditioning, while exposure therapy is extinction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEA: Interventions Based on Operant Conditioning (18 items)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[086] Overcorrection, which is used to reduce or eliminate an undesirable behavior, consists of restitution (fixing any negative consequences) and positive practice (practicing more appropriate behaviors).

[075] The technique used by the mother to teach a young child with autism spectrum disorder to wave good-bye is known as shaping, which involves reinforcing successive approximations to the desired behavior until the desired behavior is established.

[096] The Premack principle, where a high-frequency behavior is used as a reinforcer for a low-frequency behavior, is used when a father tells his son he can play video games only after he finishes his homework.

[030] Covert sensitization, pairing an image of the deviant behavior with an image that naturally produces an unpleasant reaction, is used to help a client with exhibitionistic disorder stop exposing himself in public.

[10-1] Response cost is an application of negative punishment, which reduces or eliminates a behavior by removing a positive reinforcer whenever the behavior occurs.

[11] Chaining is used to establish a complex behavior that consists of a sequence of responses that occur in a fixed order, in contrast to shaping, which is used to establish a behavior by reinforcing successive approximations to (not components of) the behavior.

[10-2] Habituation is one of the reasons why punishment tends to become less effective over time.

[09-1] Differential reinforcement combines positive reinforcement and operant extinction.

[08-1] Of the interventions listed, operant extinction is the least likely to be the optimal intervention when a child's target behavior is harmful to him/herself or others because it often causes an increase in the behavior before it begins to decrease.

[08-2] Shaping is also known as successive approximation conditioning, a behavioral technique that involves reinforcing successive approximations to the desired behavior.

[09-2] The Premack principle, a type of positive reinforcement in which a high-frequency behavior (a highly desirable activity) is used as a reinforcer for a low-frequency behavior (an undesirable activity) to increase the low-frequency behavior, is useful for helping a middle school student who rarely finishes his homework just because he doesn't like doing it.

[10-3] Using the overcorrection technique to alter a child's undesirable behavior may require providing the child with verbal instructions and/or physical guidance.

[008] Differential reinforcement for alternative or appropriate behavior (DRA) is used to decrease an undesirable behavior and increase one or more specific alternative desirable behaviors that already occur at least occasionally.

[014] The goal(s) of the child's problematic behavior is/are the initial step in choosing the appropriate function-based intervention for the child.

[002] Positive practice, which is used in overcorrection, is most similar to habit reversal training.

[072] Overcorrection is ordinarily classified as a type of positive punishment.

[206] The Premack principle is based on the assumption that high probability behaviors can be used to increase low probability behaviors.

[148] Task analysis is the essential first step when using chaining, an intervention to establish a new behavior that consists of separate responses (links in the behavior chain) and involves teaching the individual how to perform each response in the behavior chain sequentially, starting with the first or the last response.
