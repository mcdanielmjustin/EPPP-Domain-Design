--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[136] Proactive interference occurs when prior learning (e.g., Spanish) interferes with the ability to learn or recall new information (e.g., French), as illustrated by Ella's experience.

[144] The keyword method is particularly useful for foreign (second) language learning.

[103] Tolman and Honzik concluded that rats allowed to explore a maze without being given a reward formed cognitive maps of the maze, confirming that latent learning occurs without reinforcement.

[125] Prospective memory refers to memory for tasks that must be performed or events that will occur in the future, such as remembering that you have a dentist appointment next Thursday morning.

[114] Miller's (1956) "magical number seven, plus or minus two" refers to the capacity of short-term memory, which Miller found to be limited to between five and nine (seven plus and minus two) chunks of information.

[129] Sensory memory has a large capacity and brief duration, storing information directly from the environment for about one-quarter second to four seconds.

[107] Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory attributes the acquisition of many complex behaviors to observing the behavior of others.

[118] Wolfgang Kohler concluded that deriving a solution to a problem can be the result of insight, which involves mentally restructuring the elements of the problem in order to see it in a new way.

[146] The method of loci, which involves visually placing each item in a list of unrelated words in different locations in a familiar place, is most useful for remembering such a list.

[138] Baddeley's multi-component model of working memory identifies the episodic buffer as responsible for integrating new verbal and visual information.

[13] The episodic buffer is a component of working memory, as described by Baddeley (2000).

[12] Episodic and semantic memory are types of declarative memory.

[14] Retroactive interference, where more recently acquired information interferes with the ability to recall previously learned information, explains why you called your co-worker's husband "Bob" after earlier meeting him as "Bill".

[11] Without rehearsal, information remains in short-term memory for about 20 to 30 seconds.

[13] The research by Jenkins and Dallenbach (1924) found that people who slept after learning new information recalled the information better than those who stayed awake for the same length of time after learning the information and engaged in an unrelated activity, contradicting the predictions of trace decay theory.

[12] According to the encoding specificity hypothesis, forgetting is caused by inadequate retrieval cues, where conditions at the time of recall are not the same as the conditions at the time of encoding new information.

[14] The use of the phrase "on old Olympus towering top, a Finn and German viewed some hops" by a psychology student is an example of an acrostic technique to remember the 12 cranial nerves.

[13] In Baddeley's (2000) multi-component model of working memory, the episodic buffer is responsible for integrating information in working memory with information in long-term memory.

[14] Subjects in a memory experiment are asked to recite the alphabet two times after memorizing a list of words in order to prevent rehearsal of the list, which can be used to assess the effects of retroactive interference.

[12] When research participants are asked to memorize a list of unrelated words and then recall the words in any order after a brief delay, they will recall words from the beginning of the list better than words from the middle or end of the list, due to the serial position effect.

[11] In the method of loci, each word in a list is visually linked to a familiar site or object to help encode and recall the list of unrelated words.

[010] Elaborative rehearsal is considered the most effective way to transfer new information from short- to long-term memory.

[006] Baddeley's (2000) multi-component model describes working memory as consisting of a central executive and three subsystems, which do not include a semantic register.

[009] The primacy effect in the serial position effect is due to the transfer of information from short- to long-term memory.

[007] Research suggests that the mediator effectiveness hypothesis is most useful for understanding the "testing effect."

[005] Retroactive interference occurs when recently learned information interferes with the ability to recall previously learned information.

[048] As described by Baddeley (2000), the phonological loop temporarily stores auditory information.

[158] Priming is a method for studying implicit memory, and there are several types of priming, including repetition priming, which occurs when presentation of a word or object facilitates later identification of that word or object in a different format or context, and word-stem completion and word-fragment completion are two of the repetition priming tasks that are used to investigate implicit memory.

[136] Tolman's research with rats confirmed that learning can occur without being apparent in behavior.

[117] Subjects in a research study who read a list of semantically related words and then recalled "anger" as one of the words, even though it was not included in the list, illustrate the phenomenon of illusory memory or false memory.

[3] Retrieval from long-term memory is maximized when the conditions at the time of learning (encoding) new information are the same as the conditions when the information must be recalled, as described by the encoding specificity hypothesis.

[108] This man's symptoms are characteristic of contralateral neglect, which is caused by damage to the parietal lobe (most often the right parietal lobe), and a person with this disorder is unaware of areas and objects on the side of his/her body opposite to the location of the damage.

[097] Damage to Broca's area produces nonfluent speech with intact comprehension.

[119] Anosognosia is most commonly caused by damage to the right parietal lobe and is characterized by a lack of awareness of one's own physical disability.

[079] A split-brain patient will be able to say "knife" when the picture of a knife is projected to the right visual field, and although the patient can't say "fork," the patient will be able to pick out a fork with the left hand when the picture of a fork is briefly presented to the left visual field.

[140] Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize familiar faces.

[109] Lesions in the dorsolateral area of the prefrontal cortex are most likely to cause deficits in insight, planning, judgment, and other executive functions.

[098] Sperry and Gazzaniga's (1967) "split-brain patients" had their corpus callosums severed as a treatment for severe epileptic seizures.

[120] Damage to certain areas of the dominant parietal lobe can produce Gerstmann's syndrome, which involves four symptoms: finger agnosia, left-right confusion, agraphia (difficulty writing), and acalculia (difficulty performing simple mathematical operations), but not ataxia (loss of muscle control), which is usually caused by damage to the cerebellum.

[131] Individuals with Wernicke's aphasia have impaired comprehension of spoken and written language and fluent speech that's devoid of meaning.

[07] Conduction aphasia, which is usually caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, is characterized by fluent spontaneous speech, normal comprehension, and impaired repetition.

[05] Ideomotor apraxia is usually caused by damage to the left (dominant) parietal lobe.

[09] Damage to the frontal lobe causes perseveration, which involves repetition of the same response or action when it's inappropriate to do so in a variety of situations and on a variety of tasks.

[06] A split-brain patient presented with the word "COPYCAT" will say "CAT" and point to "COPY" with their left hand, as the left visual field and right hemisphere cannot communicate with the right visual field and left hemisphere.

[08] The dichotic listening task is used to obtain information about hemispheric specialization.

[08] Lesions in the parietal lobe cause the condition of tactile agnosia, in which a person is unable to recognize familiar objects by touch following a closed head injury.

[09] Right hemisphere damage is associated with impairments in both emotional prosody and pragmatics.

[06] Left-hemisphere dominance for language is found in about 95% of right-handed people and 70% of left-handed people.

[05] Following a stroke that caused left-sided hemiplegia, a woman exhibiting asomatognosia, which is a lack of recognition or awareness of part of one's own body, often involving the left hemiplegic arm and accompanied by anosognosia, a lack of awareness or denial of one's illness, due to damage to certain areas of the right parietal lobe.

[07] Conduction aphasia is characterized by relatively intact comprehension, fluent aphasia, anomia, and impaired repetition, and is caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus.

[05] Damage to the left parietal lobe can result in ideomotor apraxia, an inability to perform purposeful motor movements when asked to do so.

[06] Carl's symptoms of contralateral neglect, including bumping into things on the left side and drawing only the right side of a house, indicate an injury to his parietal lobe.

[04] Damage to the orbitofrontal region of the prefrontal cortex is most suggestive of the symptoms exhibited by a 48-year-old man with a traumatic brain injury, including emotion dysregulation, immature behavior, impulsivity, and lack of empathy.

[017] Frontal lobe damage often has an adverse effect on motivation, judgment, and memory but not on IQ test scores, as frontal lobe damage seems to have a negative impact on divergent thinking but not on convergent thinking which is what is measured by standard IQ tests.

[009] Conduction aphasia involves fluent (but paraphasic) speech, relatively intact comprehension, poor word repetition, and impaired naming.

[209] A 74-year-old woman experiences complete paralysis on the right side of her body, which is referred to as hemiplegia and is due to damage in the left side of her brain.

[058] Symptoms of frontal lobe injury are most likely to include an inability to interact spontaneously with others, fluctuations in mood, and difficulty planning a complex sequence of movements.

[149] People with limb-kinetic apraxia would have the most trouble picking up a paper clip or small coin from a table, as this type of apraxia involves an inability to make precise, coordinated movements with fingers, hands, arms, or legs.

[068] The consolidation of emotional memories is mediated primarily by the amygdala.

[046] The cerebellum is the brain area most likely affected by the skateboarding accident that caused Cody, a 17-year-old, to exhibit symptoms like clumsiness, slurred speech, and other symptoms associated with alcohol intoxication.

[057] The thalamus processes and transfers all incoming sensory information except olfactory information to appropriate areas in the cerebral cortex.

[076] The hippocampus is involved in consolidating long-term declarative memories, and its injury would likely result in the inability to form new long-term declarative memories, as seen in the young woman with a traumatic brain injury.

[043] Electrical stimulation of a person's ascending reticular activating system will wake up a sleeping person and cause an awake person to become more alert.

[087] Kluver and Bucy (1938) found that bilateral lesioning of the amygdala, hippocampus, and temporal lobes in rhesus monkeys caused visual agnosia, reduced fear, increased docility, dietary changes, and abnormal sexual behavior.

[054] The hypothalamus helps maintain the body's homeostasis by regulating body temperature, fluid and electrolyte balance, blood pressure, and other important functions.

[065] The basal ganglia are involved in the regulation of voluntary movement and consist of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus, and a number of disorders have been linked to abnormalities in these structures including Tourette's disorder, ADHD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

[02] Research has found that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have increased activity in the basal ganglia.

[04] Various areas of the hypothalamus have been linked to different types of aggressive behavior in several animal species, with electrical stimulation of the medial hypothalamus usually producing affective attack behavior and electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus producing stalking attack behavior in cats and other animal species.

[03] The suprachiasmatic nucleus controls the sleep-wake cycle by triggering changes in the release of melatonin by the pineal gland.

[01] People with bilateral damage to the amygdala often have difficulty recognizing negative emotions in facial expressions, especially fear.

[03] Areas of the cerebral cortex involved in the planning and execution of movement send excitatory signals to the striatum.

[04] Stress-induced increases in cortisol levels in the hippocampus have been linked to impairments in the retrieval of declarative memories.

[02] The amnesia associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is due to damage to the thalamus and mammillary bodies.

[01] An overdose of morphine, heroin, or other opioid can cause respiratory failure because of its effects on the medulla oblongata, which controls respiration and other vital autonomic functions.

[51] Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus that is important for stimulating milk ejection during breastfeeding.

[02] Increasing the level of oxytocin in healthy adults who do not have deficits in emotion perception can cause them to become overly sensitive to the emotional facial expressions of others.

[01] Electrical stimulation of certain areas of the amygdala elicits responses associated with conditioned fear such as freezing, increased heart rate and blood pressure, and release of stress hormones.

[03] Opioid-induced respiratory depression is due to the effects of opiates on receptors in the medulla.

[020] Neuroimaging studies have linked posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to a reduced volume of the hippocampus, decreased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and increased activity in the amygdala.

[003] The suprachiasmatic nucleus located in the hypothalamus controls the body's circadian rhythms (24-hour cycles), which include the sleep-wake cycle and daily changes in core body temperature and the secretion of several hormones.

[002] The medulla oblongata is part of the hindbrain, and damage can result in death because it regulates a number of vital life functions.

[015] Sam's inability to remove the cork from the wine bottle despite knowing the goal is an example of apraxia.

[025] A meta-analysis of 17 investigations using neuroimaging to study the brain activity of individuals with major depressive disorder before and after psychotherapy suggested that therapy decreased activity in the left precentral gyrus and increased activity in the cingulate cortex.

[105] Intravenous administration of vitamin B1 (thiamine) is the primary treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy.

[188] Ataxia is the most common outcome of damage to the cerebellum and can also be due to abnormalities in the sensory or vestibular system.

[139] High scores on the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale were most associated with increased volume of the striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia.

PHY: Emotions and Stress (11 items)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[159] Damage to the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex is most likely to produce depression or emotional volatility, while damage to the right hemisphere can produce inappropriate indifference or euphoria.

[153] The James-Lange theory suggests that a stimulus is perceived, bodily arousal and behavior occur, and emotion is then experienced.

[172] According to Lazarus's (1991) cognitive appraisal theory, primary appraisal involves considering whether an external event is relevant or irrelevant and, if relevant, whether it's positive/benign or stressful.

[17] Error: Rewrite failed

[18] The Papez circuit plays a fundamental role in emotions and memory, as it is involved in the experience and expression of emotions, as well as the storage of emotional memories.

[18] People with damage to the certain areas of the right (non-dominant) hemisphere are likely to exhibit an indifference reaction, while people with damage to the left (dominant) hemisphere are more likely to exhibit a catastrophic reaction.

[16] The facial feedback hypothesis, which proposes that facial expressions can produce the corresponding emotions, is consistent with the James-Lange theory of emotion.

[17] Allostasis refers to the body's ability to adapt to stress and achieve a state of stability through a process of change.

[005] Cognitive appraisal theory distinguishes between three types of appraisal, where secondary appraisal involves determining what personal and environmental resources a person has to cope with a stressful event.

[010] Schachter and Singer's cognitive arousal theory proposes that emotions are due to a combination of physiological arousal in response to an external event and cognitive attributions for that arousal, and that physiological arousal is similar for all emotions with differences in the experience of emotions due to differences in the attributions.

[047] The Cannon-Bard theory proposes that physiological arousal and the experience of emotion occur simultaneously and independently in response to a stimulus.

PHY: Memory and Sleep (17 items)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[165] Advanced sleep phase, involving an earlier sleep-wake cycle, is most characteristic of older adults.

[147] Long-term potentiation (LTP), which involves an increase in synaptic efficacy as the result of repetitive stimulation, has been linked to memory storage.

[171] Following a traumatic brain injury, a middle-aged woman experiencing considerable anterograde and retrograde amnesia will most likely remember where she and her family went on vacation three years ago first, as many patients with retrograde amnesia exhibit "shrinking retrograde amnesia" over time, with the most distant memories returning first.

[154] The three stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are characterized by high-amplitude, low-frequency EEG activity.

[160] Kandel's (2001) research with the sea snail, Aplysia, provided information on neuronal changes associated with learning and memory.

[166] Infants less than three months of age usually begin a sleep period with REM sleep.

[15] Dreams occur during REM and non-REM sleep, but they occur more often during REM sleep, and are longer, more bizarre and emotional, and more likely to be recalled when they occur during REM sleep.

[16] Studies using functional neuroimaging techniques have found that the prefrontal cortex is essential for prospective memory.

[17] Delta waves are characteristic of deep sleep.

[16] Drugs that block protein synthesis while acquiring new information interfere with the formation of long-term memories but not short-term memories.

[15] Fred and Ethel's newborn infant will begin each sleep period with active sleep, which is most similar to stage R sleep in adults.

[14] Kandel and his associates (e.g., Kandel, 1976) used sea slugs (Aplysia) as subjects for their research on neuronal changes associated with learning and memory because sea slugs have a simple nervous system that consists of a small number of large neurons.

[021] Implicit memories, including memories of learned skills and actions (procedural memory) and conditioned responses, are stored in the cerebellum and basal ganglia areas of the brain.

[018] Infants spend about 16 to 20 hours each day sleeping, with about 50% of this time in REM sleep, and this proportion of REM sleep drops to about 25% by age five and continues at that level during the rest of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.

[205] Compared to younger adults, older adults wake up more frequently during the night, but older adults do not require less sleep than younger adults do and often take daytime naps to compensate for shorter sleep time during the night, and they have a longer sleep latency and spend less time in slow-wave (deep) sleep.

[35] The EEG for stage 2 of non-REM sleep consists of theta waves that are interrupted by prominent sleep spindles and K complexes.

[198] Following a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy, H.M. was unable to form new long-term declarative memories, while his short-term memory and procedural memory were intact.

[195] An antagonist produces no effect on its own but, instead, blocks the action of a neurotransmitter at receptor sites or inhibits the synthesis or release of the neurotransmitter.

[024] The autonomic nervous system's sympathetic branch is involved in mobilizing the body's "fight-or-flight" response to stress.

[013] Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, and disruption of its production or transmission in certain areas of the brain produces anxiety.

[032] The parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for returning the body to a calm state after a fear reaction.

[010] The dopamine hypothesis attributes schizophrenia to elevated levels of or oversensitivity to dopamine in certain areas of the brain.

[021] Chronic glutamate excitotoxicity has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and several other neurodegenerative disorders.

[10] Suicide attempters with low levels of serotonin metabolites in their cerebrospinal fluid are at higher risk than those with higher levels for repeated suicide attempts and completed suicide.

[11] A GABA agonist enhances the inhibitory effects of GABA.

[12] According to the all-or-none law, the intensity of a nerve impulse is independent of stimulus intensity as long as the intensity reaches a minimum level.

[12] Dopamine is the neurotransmitter that regulates activity in the mesolimbic pathway and is known to be an important contributor to the rewarding effects of cocaine, amphetamines, and other addictive drugs.

[11] Acetylcholine (ACh) facilitates movement by stimulating the muscles to contract.

[10] The all-or-none law applies to the intensity of action potentials, where once a minimum level of stimulation is reached, an action potential occurs within a neuron and its intensity does not vary.

[09] Curare causes paralysis of the skeletal muscles by blocking acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions.

[023] When the dendrites of a neuron receive sufficient stimulation from other neurons, depolarization occurs as positively charged sodium ions enter the neuron.

[5] The etiology of neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease has been linked to a low level of acetylcholine and a high level of glutamate.

[30] Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that binds to both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, which are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems.

PHY: Neurological and Endocrine Disorders (26 items)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[035] Functional neuroimaging techniques include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron-emission tomography (PET), and single proton emission computed tomography (SPECT), but not computed tomography (CT), which is a structural neuroimaging technique.

[177] The motor symptoms of Huntington's disease have been linked to GABA and glutamate abnormalities in the basal ganglia, especially the caudate nucleus and putamen.

[183] The factor that distinguishes primary hypertension from secondary hypertension is whether or not the cause of the disorder is known.

[189] The symptoms of feeling cold, tired, having trouble remembering things, constipation, dry skin, and weight gain are most suggestive of the endocrine disorder hypothyroidism.

[178] A stroke involving the middle cerebral artery that affects a patient's dominant hemisphere is most likely to produce contralateral hemiparesis, contralateral homonymous hemianopia, dysarthria, and aphasia.

[196] Excessive secretion of the hormone thyroxine by the thyroid gland causes hyperthyroidism, which produces tremor, sweating, tachycardia, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, sensitivity to heat, and unexplained weight loss.

[184] A progressive loss of dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinson's disease.

[190] Classic migraine headaches begin with an aura, involve throbbing pain that may be limited to one side of the head and worsen with physical activity, along with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and/or sound.

[20] Diabetes insipidus is usually caused by a low level of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is secreted by the pituitary gland, leading to extreme thirst and the excretion of excessive and diluted urine.

[21] A 54-year-old woman with retrograde amnesia following a closed head injury will likely remember the family reunion she attended 4-1/2 years ago first as the recovery of long-term memories following a traumatic brain injury ordinarily involves "shrinking retrograde amnesia" in which more distant (remote) memories are recovered first.

[19] A young woman started having simple partial seizures when she was a child, experiencing motor and sensory symptoms including jerky movements, eye blinking, and abnormal sensations without losing consciousness.

[63] Diffusion tensor imaging is used to study abnormalities in the brain's white matter.

[21] Insulin overproduction by the pancreas can cause a decrease in blood glucose levels and hypoglycemia.

[22] Generalized onset seizures always include a loss of consciousness, and there is evidence that auras can occur for some people with generalized onset seizures.

[20] An ischemic stroke is most often caused by a blockage in a cerebral artery, in contrast to a hemorrhagic stroke which is due to bleeding that occurs when there is a rupture in a cerebral artery.

[18] Neuroimaging studies have found that glucose hypometabolism and atrophy in the caudate nucleus and putamen precede the onset of the clinical symptoms of Huntington's disease.

[20] Bilateral vision loss is the symptom least likely to be associated with a stroke involving the middle cerebral artery.

[19] The return of older long-term memories before more recent long-term memories following a head injury that caused retrograde amnesia is referred to as "shrinking retrograde amnesia".

[21] Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical intervention for Parkinson's disease that involves implanting electrodes to deliver electrical impulses to target areas in the brain, which reduces symptoms by altering brain activity in those areas.

[011] When one parent has a single autosomal dominant gene for Huntington's disease, each biological child of that parent has a 50% chance of having that disease.

[024] FDG-PET is the most useful neuroimaging technique for distinguishing between neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease and other neurocognitive disorders.

[139] Retinal disparity refers to differences in retinal images in the left and right eyes and is responsible for depth perception of objects that are at a close distance, in contrast to motion parallax, interposition, and linear perspective which are responsible for depth perception of objects at a greater distance.

[130] Individuals with synesthesia are likely to experience different sounds as different colors.

[148] Animals that have more rods than cones have better peripheral vision and better night vision compared to animals that have more cones than rods.

[14] According to Weber's law, a just noticeable difference in stimulus intensity is a constant proportion of the magnitude of the initial stimulus intensity.

[13] Opponent process theory best explains the experience of negative afterimages, proposing that there are three types of bipolar receptor cells in the visual system - red/green, yellow/blue, and white/black.

[14] Stevens's law is based on the results of research that used the method of magnitude estimation to study the relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and its perceived magnitude.

[15] Top-down processing is concept-driven.

[12] Compared to cones, rods are more important for peripheral vision.

[11] The ability to read and understand text that contains multiple errors is attributable to top-down processing which occurs when the brain uses pre-existing knowledge and expectations to interpret perceptual information, allowing you to unconsciously and automatically correct the errors while reading.

[13] Convergence is a binocular cue that contributes to depth perception.

[019] The cones, not the rods, are responsible for visual acuity (sharpness and precise detail) and the perception of color, but not peripheral vision.

[008] Bottom-up processing is data driven.

[071] In signal detection theory, d-prime (d') indicates the difference between the standard scores for the hit rate and false alarm rate.

[217] Motor disturbances are a more important cause of disability in the early stages of neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies than in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

[221] The course of vascular neurocognitive disorder varies and may involve an acute onset of symptoms or a stepwise or progressive decline in functioning with fluctuations in symptoms or plateaus of varying length.

[27] In the early stage of Alzheimer's disease, an MRI is most likely to reveal degeneration in the entorhinal cortex.

[28] Neurocognitive disorder due to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, categorized in DSM-5 as neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease, typically progresses very rapidly compared to other types of neurocognitive disorders.

[27] Memory loss associated with neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease has been most consistently linked to abnormal levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.

[28] Aphasia is least likely to be exhibited by a patient with neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection or other subcortical neurocognitive disorder, as it is more characteristic of cortical neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.

[26] Neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies is not characterized by perseverative behavior, which is a diagnostic criterion for frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder.

[27] Neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease is associated with an accumulation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala.
