Exam 1,Question 176,"Wolpe (1958) believed that counterconditioning was responsible for the effectiveness of his technique of systematic desensitization for eliminating an anxiety response to a particular stimulus. However, studies using the dismantling strategy found that its effects are actually due to:",A. extinction.,"EPPP-P1-LEA-Interventions Based on Classical Conditioning-031 Answer A is correct. Use of the dismantling strategy to identify the effects of the elements of an intervention involves comparing the elements by administering different elements to different groups of subjects. When this strategy was used to determine which elements of systematic desensitization accounted for its effectiveness, researchers found it was repeated exposure to the feared (conditioned) stimulus that eliminated the anxiety response and that pairing the feared stimulus with a stimulus that produced relaxation (counterconditioning) was unnecessary.

Mowrer's two-factor theory of learning proposes that some behaviors are the result of a combination of classical and operant conditioning. Avoidance conditioning is an example of two-factor learning because it combines classical conditioning and negative reinforcement (operant conditioning). For example, a rat may learn that it can escape (stop) an electric shock by pressing a bar, which is the negative reinforcement component. Then, if a flashing light signals that the shock is about to occur, the light becomes paired with the shock so that the light elicits anticipatory fear, which is the classical conditioning component.

Skewed distributions are asymmetrical with most scores ""piled up"" in one tail of the distribution and a few scores in the other tail: In a negatively skewed distribution, the few scores are in the negative tail (the low end of the distribution); in a positively skewed distribution, the few scores are in the positive tail (the high end of the distribution) - i.e., the ""tail tells the tale."" In both types of skewed distributions, the mean, median, and mode do not equal the same value: Instead, the mean is in the tail with the few scores, the median is in the middle, and the mode is in the tail containing most of the scores.

To analyze the main and interaction effects of treatment and condition on systolic blood pressure, Dr. Oz will use which of the following statistical tests?",C. two-way ANOVA,"EPPP-P2-RMS-Inferential Statistical Tests-102 Answer C is correct. The first two things to do when choosing an inferential statistical test are to identify (1) the independent and dependent variables and (2) the scale of measurement of the dependent variable. This study has two independent variables - treatment and condition - and one dependent variable - systolic blood pressure. You may have had trouble with this question because you were uncertain about the scale of measurement of systolic blood pressure. However, a general rule is that most physical measurements (including systolic blood pressure) represent an interval or ratio scale, which means that the appropriate statistical test will be a t-test or analysis of variance. To choose between the t-test, the two-way ANOVA, and the MANOVA, you have to consider how many independent and dependent variables there are. There are two independent variables, which eliminates the t-test because it's used when there's only one independent variable; and there is one dependent variable, which eliminates the MANOVA because it's used when there are two or more dependent variables.

Exam 4,Question 173,Research by Jenkins and Dallenbach (1924) found that people who slept after learning new information recalled the information better than did people who stayed awake for the same length of time after learning the information and engaged in an unrelated activity. They concluded that the results of their study contradict the predictions of which of the following?,C. trace decay theory,"EPPP-P4-LEA-Memory and Forgetting-13 Answer C is correct. According to trace decay theory, memories create physical changes in the brain that deteriorate over time when the memories are not rehearsed or recalled. Research comparing subjects who slept or stayed awake after learning new information seems to contradict this prediction since it found that people who sleep recall more information than those who stay awake even though the interval of time between learning and recall was the same for all subjects. Note, however, that the Jenkins and Dallenbach study has been criticized on methodological grounds because there is evidence that newly learned information is consolidated during sleep and, therefore, is not decaying. Because their research did not adequately test the predictions of trace decay theory, it neither contradicts nor supports it. (J. G. Jenkins and K. M.

Exam 5,Question 207,"When using the multitrait-multimethod matrix, a small monotrait-heteromethod coefficient indicates that the test:",A. lacks adequate convergent validity.,"EPPP-F1-TES-Test Validity - Content and Construct Validity-05 Answer A is correct. The monotrait-heteromethod coefficient indicates the correlation between the test being evaluated for construct validity and a measure of the same trait (monotrait) using a different method of measurement (heteromethod). For example, if the multitrait-multimethod matrix is being used to assess the construct validity of a self-report measure of assertiveness, a monotrait-heteromethod coefficient might be the correlation between the self-report measure of assertiveness and a teacher report measure of assertiveness. If this coefficient is small, this indicates that the assertiveness test may lack adequate convergent validity because it doesn't have a high correlation with a test it should correlate with. (A measure's construct validity is demonstrated when it has adequate levels of both convergent and divergent validity.)",TES,Test Validity - Content and Construct Validity,"The monotrait-heteromethod coefficient indicates the correlation between the test being evaluated for construct validity and a measure of the same trait (monotrait) using a different method of measurement (heteromethod).

Exam 6,Question 32,"A psychology intern working at a mental health clinic tells her supervisor that, during the first session with a new client, he revealed that he's gay. The intern says she does not want to work with this client or any other gay or lesbian clients because homosexuality violates her religious beliefs. The supervisor should:",D. determine if it's necessary to reassign the intern's current client to another therapist and discuss with the intern ways that might help her reconcile the conflict between her religious beliefs and the requirement that psychologists work effectively with diverse (including homosexual) clients.,"EPPP-P6-ETH-APA Ethics Code Standards 7 & 8-026 Answer D is correct. Conflicts between religious values and professional competence when working with diverse clients have been addressed by a number of experts. For example, the APA's Virtual Working Group on Restrictions Affecting Diversity Training in Graduate Education developed a Sample Program Policy Statement that articulates the policy for APA-accredited programs when trainees experience conflicts when working with diverse clients. Among other things, its states that the program is committed to helping trainees develop the knowledge and skills they need to work with diverse clients and to providing trainees with additional time and faculty support to help them integrate their personal values with the professional competence they need to work with all clients. Answer D is the best answer because it not only reflects this position but also takes into account the welfare of the intern's current client. See, e.g., E. H. Wise, K. J. Bieschke, L. Forrest, J.

The choice of the appropriate measure of central tendency not only depends on the scale of measurement of the data but also on several other factors including the shape of the data distribution. When the data represent an interval or ordinal scale, the mean is ordinarily the appropriate measure of central tendency. However, when the distribution is skewed, the mean may provide misleading information because its magnitude is affected by the extreme outliers. Consequently, for a skewed distribution, the median is a better measure of central tendency because it's not affected by the extreme outliers and is more representative of the typical score in the distribution.

Exam 6,Question 102,"To decrease an undesirable behavior and increase one or more specific alternative desirable behaviors that already occur at least occasionally, you would use which of the following?",B. DRA,"EPPP-P6-LEA-Interventions Based on Operant Conditioning-008 Answer B is correct. DRA (differential reinforcement for alternative or appropriate behavior) is used to reduce or eliminate an undesirable behavior and increase one or more specific desirable behaviors that already occur at least occasionally. It involves removing all reinforcement (e.g., attention) following the undesirable behavior and providing reinforcement whenever a specified alternative behavior occurs. DRL (differential reinforcement of low rates of behavior) is used to reduce a behavior to a more acceptable level by providing reinforcement only when the behavior occurs at or below that level. It does not involve reinforcing alternative behaviors. DRO (differential reinforcement of other behavior) is used to reduce or eliminate an undesirable behavior by providing reinforcement after specified intervals of time only when the individual hasn't engaged in the undesirable behavior during each interval. In contrast to DRA, DRO does not require the individual to engage in any specific alternative behaviors during each interval, only that he/she doesn't engage in the undesirable behavior. DRI (differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior) is used to reduce or eliminate an undesirable behavior and increase a desirable and physically incompatible behavior (i.e., a behavior that cannot be performed at the same time as the undesirable behavior is performed). Because the question doesn't mention that the desirable behaviors are incompatible with the undesirable behavior, this is not the best answer.",LEA,Interventions Based on Operant Conditioning,"DRA (differential reinforcement for alternative or appropriate behavior) is used to reduce or eliminate an undesirable behavior and increase one or more specific desirable behaviors that already occur at least occasionally.

For the past three months, Dr. Beck has been reducing his practice by referring current clients to other therapists and not accepting new clients because he and his wife are planning to move to another state to be closer to their adult son and his family. The best course of action for Dr. Beck is to:",C. agree to see Emiko in therapy until her crisis has passed and then provide her with a referral to a colleague if she needs additional therapy sessions.,"EPPP-P6-ETH-APA Ethics Code Standards 9 & 10-027 Answer C is correct. This situation is not directly addressed in ethical guidelines. However, this answer is most consistent with the ""spirit"" of the guidelines because it's the response that best addresses Emiko's welfare (see, e.g., Standard 10.09 of the APA's Ethics Code and Principle II.35 of the Canadian Code of Ethics). Answers A and B are not the best answers because Emiko seems to need immediate assistance due to her suicidal ideation, and starting therapy with a new therapist (who may not be able to see her right away) would not be adequate. And answer D is not the best answer because Emiko may or may not be capable of or motivated to follow through on the suggestion to have someone take her to the hospital if she starts feeling like she can't control the impulse to attempt suicide.",ETH,APA Ethics Code Standards 9 & 10,"This situation is not directly addressed in ethical guidelines.

Exam 6,Question 190,"During his third therapy session, a client tells his therapist that he's HIV positive. He also says that he engaged in unsafe sex with three partners after receiving his test results 18 months ago but is no longer doing so. The 1976 Tarasoff decision:",D. does not apply in this situation and the appropriate actions for the therapist and client depend on state or provincial laws.,"EPPP-P6-ETH-APA Ethics Code Standards 3 & 4-017 Answer D is correct. The original Tarasoff decision established a ""duty to warn"" an intended victim of a therapy client, but this was changed in a 1976 rehearing of the case to a ""duty to protect"" an intended victim by warning him or her directly, notifying the police, or taking other appropriate action (e.g., hospitalizing the client). Many experts agree that Tarasoff isn't relevant in situations like the one described in this question because (a) it doesn't apply to past behavior, (b) it applies only when potential victim(s) are identifiable (it's not clear if the client's partners are identifiable), and (c) the risk for harm does not necessarily rise to the level of foreseeable harm (dangerousness) required by Tarasoff since unsafe sex involves risk but not certainty that HIV will be transmitted. Note that there are other options in this situation - e.g., educating clients about safe-sex practices and encouraging clients to inform sexual partners of their HIV status, possibly with the assistance of the therapist. In addition, it's important for psychologists to be familiar with state and provincial laws that address the actions that should be taken in situations involving HIV (e.g., partner notification laws).

Chenneville, Tarasoff and HIV: Some considerations for therapists, Focus, 22(5), 5-8, 2007.",017,"The 1976 Tarasoff decision does not apply to the situation where a client discloses that he engaged in unsafe sex with three partners after receiving his HIV-positive test results 18 months ago but is no longer doing so, and the appropriate actions for the therapist and client depend on state or provincial laws."
Exam 6,Question 191,Which of the following neuroimaging techniques is most useful for distinguishing between neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease and other neurocognitive disorders?,D. FDG-PET,"EPPP-P6-PHY-Neurological and Endocrine Disorders-024 Answer D is correct. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most commonly used radioactive tracer in PET imaging, and FDG-PET provides information on glucose metabolism in the brain. Because different subtypes of neurocognitive disorder produce distinct patterns of glucose metabolism, FDG-PET can help clinicians distinguish between different disorders - for example, between neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder. See, e.g., V. K. N. Shivamurthy, A. K. Tahari, C. Marcus, and R. M. Subramaniam, Brain FDG-PET and the diagnosis of dementia, AJR, 204, W76-W85.",PHY,Neurological and Endocrine Disorders,"Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most commonly used radioactive tracer in PET imaging, and FDG-PET provides information on glucose metabolism in the brain.

Exam 6,Question 193,An initial step in choosing the appropriate function-based intervention for a child is identifying:,A. the goal(s) of the child's problematic behavior.,"EPPP-P6-LEA-Interventions Based on Operant Conditioning-014 Answer A is correct. Function-based interventions are based on the assumption that disruptive behaviors and other undesirable behaviors are performed to achieve certain goals - e.g., to gain something or to avoid or escape from something. Once the goal(s) of a child's undesirable behavior are identified from the results of a functional behavioral assessment, the next step is to create conditions in which the child's goals can be met without engaging in the undesirable behavior. For example, if a child engages in disruptive behavior in the classroom because doing so allows him to get attention from the teacher, the teacher would stop paying attention to the child when he's disruptive and, instead, pay attention to him whenever he engages in desirable behaviors (e.g., participates in classroom activities).",LEA,Interventions Based on Operant Conditioning,"Function-based interventions are based on the assumption that disruptive behaviors and other undesirable behaviors are performed to achieve certain goals - e.g., to gain something or to avoid or escape from something.

Exam 7,Question 59,"Anna, age 13, refuses to eat at a restaurant, a friend's house, or anywhere else except at home because she's afraid she might vomit if she does so. To help alleviate her fears, Anna stays away from people who are sick, eats only food that she or her mother prepared, frequently takes the garbage out to avoid bad smells in the kitchen, and often checks food to make sure it hasn't gone bad. Her symptoms began two years ago after a classmate sitting next to her in school threw up, which made Anna feel like she was going to throw up and caused her to run out of the classroom. The most likely diagnosis for Anna is:","C. specific phobia, other type.","EPPP-P7- PPA- Anxiety Disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder-077 Answer C is correct. Anna's symptoms are characteristic of emetophobia, which is a fear of vomiting.

Exam 7,Question 133,__________ is the most common outcome of damage to the cerebellum and can also be due to abnormalities in the sensory or vestibular system.,A. Ataxia,"EPPP-P7- PHY- Brain Regions/Functions - Hindbrain, Midbrain, and Subcortical Forebrain Structures-188 Answer A is correct. Ataxia is the most common consequence of damage to the cerebellum and involves a lack of coordination and clumsiness of movement that is not due to muscular weakness. In addition to problems with gait and posture, cerebellar ataxia can cause abnormal eye movements, dysarthria (difficulty moving the muscles involved in speech), and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Apraxia (answer B) is an inability to carry out purposeful movements despite normal muscle power and control. It is most often due to damage to the parietal lobes but may also be caused by damage to the corpus callosum and certain areas of the frontal lobes. There is also evidence that damage to the cerebellum may be involved in several specific types of apraxia including oculomotor apraxia and agraphic apraxia. However, apraxia is not the correct answer because it is not the most common outcome of damage to the cerebellum, which is what this question is asking about. Dyskinesia (answer C) involves abnormal, involuntary muscle movements (e.g., twitching, fidgeting) that are caused by abnormal activity in the basal ganglia. Paresthesia (answer D) involves numbness, tingling, or other abnormal sensation in the skin. It is caused by sustained pressure or damage to a nerve in the brain or spinal cord due, for example, to a stroke or tumor.",PHY,"Brain Regions/Functions - Hindbrain, Midbrain, and Subcortical Forebrain Structures","Ataxia is the most common consequence of damage to the cerebellum and involves a lack of coordination and clumsiness of movement that is not due to muscular weakness.

Exam 7,Question 221,"Research has provided evidence for the effectiveness of voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBRT) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for treating patients with cocaine use disorder. More specifically, the studies have found that:",C. VBRT is most effective for promoting initial abstinence and CBT is most effective for preventing relapse.,"EPPP-P7- PPA- Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders-211 Answer C is correct.
